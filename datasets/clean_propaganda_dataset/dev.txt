1	Facebook Bans Outline to Stop Jihadi Attacks on Americans.
1	[Editors' note: To best understand why Facebook would ban Jamie Glazov on 9/11 for his article on how to best prevent more 9/11s, pre-order Jamie's new book, Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE.
1	The book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has successfully built his totalitarian plantation -- on which many in the West are now enslaved and dutifully following his orders.
1	Jamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]
0	Reprinted from WND.com.
1	Somewhere in the “community standards” that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy.
1	The social-media company has told author and commentator Jamie Glazov that their standards forbid his article about how to prevent jihadi attacks on Americans.
1	It’s all about Glazov’s new book, “Jihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us.”
0	At FrontPage Magazine, where he is editor, he had posted “9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad,” which included recommendations such as “Label the enemy and make a threat assessment” and “Stop ‘partnering’ with Muslim Brotherhood front groups.”
0	That apparently was too much for Facebook, which declared “only you can see this post” because it “goes against our Community Standards.”
1	He was suspended from Facebook for 30 days on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the Islamic jihadist attack on America that killed nearly 3,000.
1	Glazov told Breitbart, “This is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.”
0	FrontPage Magazine reported:
1	Facebook’s Unholy Alliance masters are, without doubt, accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression.
1	It is no surprise, therefore, that Frontpage’s editor, and host of ‘The Glazov Gang,’ was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday, on September 11, after posting his article, ‘9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.’ Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe — and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day.
1	The report said it appears “that daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook’s ‘community standards.
0	'”
1	“Glazov’s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims – a move that is, clearly, horrifying to Facebook’s masters and therefore also violates their ‘community standards,'” the report said.
1	No doubt, Glazov’s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM, honor killings and other Shariah barbarities, has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook’s guardians — who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls.
0	The report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim’s threat to him.
1	Twitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts, citing its anti-“hate” policies.
1	It is ‘hateful conduct,’ apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.
0	Indeed, Frontpage’s editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari’s texts discussing Mohammed’s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Quranic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).
1	Facebook also refused to respond to Glazov’s inquiry about “what it is specifically that violates Facebook’s ‘community standards’ when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad.”
0	Glazov has written about the subject in previous books, including “High Noon for America: The Coming Showdown” and “United in Hate.”
0	In his “9 Steps” article, he points out that the Obama administration was “cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA.”
1	The government needs, he said, to “implement a concrete ‘countering-jihad’ strategy.”
1	And he said it needs to affirm “Shariah’s assault on the U.S. Constitution as seditious.”
0	A last key point, the said, is to ridicule the enemy.
1	Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon.
1	There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Shariah and jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.
0	Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.
1	American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.
1	Hungarian Prime Minister Hits Nail On The Head: Refugees Are Actually "Muslim Invaders"
1	Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban doesn't mince words when it comes to the Muslim invasion in Europe and specifically to his own country.
1	Orban says there is not only Muslim invaders in the mix of "refugees," but also “economic migrants" seeking better lives for themselves.
0	Indeed, both of these are true.
1	There are plenty of these people who are simply happy to have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US, Russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn't belong and funding, training and arming Islamic jihadis there.
1	Then, there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad .
0	RT reports:
1	Refugees in Europe are just “Muslim invaders” and economic migrants seeking better lives, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said, adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of ‘parallel societies.’ Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees, Orban replied: “We don’t consider these people to be Muslim refugees.” Instead, the tough-talking politician said they were regarded as “Muslim invaders.” Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach Hungary from Syria, all of which are not as rich as Germany but are economically stable, the PM said.
0	He was apparently referring to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Serbia – a common route for migrants heading for ‘wealthy’ Europe.
0	“So, they are not running for their lives [in these countries].
0	They are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,” Orban concluded.
1	He stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they “don’t want” immigration.
0	In his view, the government simply can’t go against the will of the people.
1	And Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country.
0	RT continues:
0	Going further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany.
1	“The reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,” he said, describing the issue “politically” as a European problem but, “sociologically,” as a German problem.
0	Orban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘open-door’ policy towards asylum seekers.
1	“I’ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,” he said.
1	The recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban.
0	“If someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: ‘Can we come in, can we stay?’ They [asylum seekers] didn’t do that, they crossed the border illegally,” he stated.
0	Orban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism.
1	He called it an "illusion" and said that Christian and Muslim societies “will never unite.”
0	Of course, they won't.
1	They have absolutely nothing in common.
1	They cannot agree on God's law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States.
1	They cannot agree on the Scriptures.
1	They cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ.
0	They can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.
0	PM Orban has remained consistent.
1	He has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back.
1	He has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has.
0	Orban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!
1	He has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, "That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people."
1	Furthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros.
1	Anti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, "At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe.
1	And while Orban is right that these are 'economic migrants,' they are also 'Muslim invaders.'"
0	"They don’t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values," she added.
1	"Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm German values, and European values in general, with sharia values.
1	They are in Europe to conquer and Islamize it, with willing and eager help from Europe’s short-sighted, self-serving, internationalist intelligentsia."
1	Indeed!
1	Thank you Prime Minister Orban for saying what needed to be said!
0	US Conference of Mayors Call For More Gun Confiscation Legislation
1	The United States Conference of Mayors passed several resolutions last week that called for more gun confiscation legislation following all the debate about guns after several shootings, despite the fact that government has never been given authority to restrict or regulate arms.
1	Part of the hypocrisy of the US Conference of Mayors is that they actually push to infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights while claiming that it is consistent with the Second Amendment.
1	For example, the organization writes in support of David Hogg's #NeverAgain movement, "WHEREAS, the U.S. Conference of Mayors has a 50-year history of formally adopting and aggressively promoting strong policies to reduce gun violence, all consistent with its support for the Second Amendment to the Constitution."

0	You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
1	And just what kind of policies are we talking about?
0	According to the mayors:
0	Strengthening the Regulation of Gun Sales and Dealers, including: Limiting the number of guns a person may purchase in a single transaction or in a month or other specified period of time;
0	Banning replica handguns;
0	Increasing inspections of licensed gun dealers; and
0	Targeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers; Banning Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines, including: Reinstating a strengthened, effective ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47s, and their component parts; and
0	Banning large capacity ammunition feeding devices and the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips.
0	Supporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents;
0	Providing local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data;
0	Opposing "Stand Your Ground" or "Shoot First" laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and
0	Encouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools;
0	Raising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age;
0	Banning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns.
0	Protecting Domestic Violence Victims, including:
0	Prohibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and
0	Requiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own;
1	How any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess.
1	I think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people.
0	How does any of this stop gun violence?
0	It doesn't.
1	What it does do is infringe on the rights of teachers, law-abiding citizens who want to purchase several guns which they will use lawfully, sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime.
0	Banning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban.
1	These geniuses also "Support Enactment of Comprehensive Background Checks, Ban the Sale of Bump Stocks and Related Devices and Prevent the Arming of Teachers in Schools."
0	Again, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns.
0	Why?
1	Because they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!
0	On top of that, the criminal mayors want to institute red flag laws.
0	"The U.S. Conference of Mayors registers its strong support for extreme risk protection order laws and urges both states and the federal government to enact such laws," the group wrote.
1	They are fully in support of violating the Fifth Amendment rights of otherwise law-abiding citizens based on merely the fact that someone claims that a family member is a harm to themselves or others, even though they have not committed a crime.
1	This is the Trump, "Take the guns first and then due process" mantra.
0	Guns.com reported on some of the statements made by some of these mayors.
0	Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana and chairwoman of the conference’s criminal and social justice committee, said gun-related tragedies “rips families and communities apart.” “Policies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives.
0	It’s as simple as that,” Freeman-Wilson said.
1	“The U.S. Conference of Mayors will continue doing everything in our power to keep our communities safe so that children and families are able to live free of the fear of being gunned down.” St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said the new resolutions show mayors will “lead the way in solving our gun violence crisis.” “We wouldn’t be doing our jobs as mayors if we weren’t focusing on gun violence — an issue that threatens the public safety of every community, big and small,” she said.
0	“Our bipartisan network of mayors knows how to work together and compromise on policies that save lives.
0	If only our partners in Congress did the same.” Gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, praised the conference for reaffirming its support for stricter regulations.
1	“Mayors are on the frontlines of America’s gun violence crisis, so it’s no surprise they’re also leading the charge to pass common-sense, life-saving laws,” said Everytown president John Feinblatt.
1	“It’s time for our leaders in Washington to follow the lead of America’s mayors and put public safety over NRA priorities.”
0	None of these statements can be backed up by facts.
1	The facts refute their arguments, but beyond that, the Second Amendment recognizes the right to keep and bear arms is a right given to us by our Creator, not a permission we gain from government.
1	So, while they tell you they support the Second Amendment and that their unlawful policies are consistent with it, nothing could be further from the truth.
0	If you buy into this, you probably think places like Chicago, Illinois are among the safest places to live in the US when the opposite is true.

1	Puerto Rico’s Power Grid Failure Is Causing A Public Health Crisis Of Epic Proportions
1	One month after the devastating Hurricane Maria wreaked havoc on the island of Puerto Rico, the territory is still facing a public health crisis.
1	And it’s a crisis of epic proportions.
0	On Friday, former Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro García Padilla tweeted a photo from inside a hospital, in which scrubbed-up doctors leaned over an operating table performing surgery lit only by a flashlight.
0	According to Slate, the image quickly made the rounds on the internet; it currently has almost 9,000 retweets and many speculate that that’s probably because the blurry picture feels like it’s worth a good deal more than 1,000 words.
0	It illuminates just a small sliver of the public health crisis Puerto Rico is currently facing.
0	This is what POTUS calls a 10!
0	Surgery performed with cellphones as flashlights in Puerto Rico today.
0	pic.twitter.com/5pnK5dkkE6 — Alejandro (@agarciapadilla) October 21, 2017
0	Millions of residents still don’t have access to electricity or proper health care, and bacteria in the water have exposed many people to disease.
1	And calls for help have gone unanswered besides the few willing to travel to the devastated island privately.
1	Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) along with a handful of other lawmakers are calling on the federal government to continue to provide aid to the post-apocalyptic ravaged territory.
0	“Even before Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the U.S. territories, the islands’ health care system was suffering from the ongoing economic crisis.
1	The islands are grappling with physician shortages, Medicaid programs facing an impending funding cliff, and widespread disparities in Federal health programs—and that was before hurricane season,” the lawmakers stated in a letter.
1	“We are grateful for the public health emergency declaration in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but more can and should be done to help Americans impacted by these disasters.”
0	The senators stressed that much of the islands’ power and communication networks are out and, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it will take months before power is fully restored.
0	Hospitals have been forced to prioritize patients, ration services, and forgo elective surgeries.
0	The power grid’s failure has caused more problems than many anticipated, like the stall of relief efforts.
0	Without electricity, communications are non-existent too.
0	Some 33 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, only 23 percent of residents have electricity, according to Status.pr, which provides daily updates on basic services on the island.
1	While there are still other problems as well, such as gas stations being slow to reopen, and roads getting badly damaged, the power grid’s utter annihilation in the category 4 winds is not just a temporary inconvenience.
0	The different ways that the lack of electricity can set off a cascade of other crises is becoming increasingly clear.
0	A giant government-owned hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, arrived in Puerto Rico weeks ago to help out, but many people don’t know about the ship.
0	Without electricity, most cell phone towers are down.
0	But even if communications were working, residents can’t get to the port, as many of the island’s roads are impassable and most are without gasoline to power a car.
0	The ship has extensive space and equipment for trauma care and a large staff, but CNN reported that as of last Tuesday, only 33 of 250 beds were full.
1	The looming crisis seems to be getting worse, not better, and Puerto Rico is experiencing a medical crisis of epic proportions.
1	How Many Child Rapists Did a Sanctuary City Mayor Tip Off?
0	The price of a sanctuary city for illegal aliens is paid in abused children.
0	Just ask the abused children of Oakland.
0	A sweep of Northern California by federal immigration officials this week, which was partly thwarted when the Oakland mayor sounded the alarm, nabbed a number of illegal immigrants convicted of a variety of serious and violent crimes.
0	Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials announced this week that the four-day raid led to the arrest of 232 illegal immigrants in the San Francisco Bay Area.
0	Of those 232, 180 “were either convicted criminals, had been issued a final order of removal and failed to depart the United States, or had been previously removed” from the country and had come back illegally.
0	The arrests included 115 who "had prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors."
0	The numbers might have been greater, but for the intervention of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who tweeted out a warning of the impending raid, tipping off others who might have been caught...
0	"I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety," Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area.
0	"People should be able to live without fear or panic and know their rights and responsibilities as well as their recourses."
0	U.S. judge frees Indonesian immigrant held by Trump order
0	A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration’s order to deport them.
0	SPONSORED
0	Rombot, part of a wave of Indonesian Christians who fled their country following deadly riots in 1998, learned of the policy change when he appeared for an Aug. 1 check-in with ICE and was arrested.
0	“He walks out of the courthouse right now,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris said after concluding that Rombot’s detention violated his rights.
0	He walked out of the U.S. District Court in Boston in his blue jail scrubs, without a chance to change into street clothes.
0	Rombot’s lawyers said he was arrested despite a 2015 letter from ICE saying he would have a chance to prepare for an “orderly” departure.
0	The judge cited that letter during Wednesday’s hearing in holding that Rombot’s detention despite ICE’s previous guidance violated his due process rights under the U.S. Constitution.
0	“This is what intent was, that he would be given the opportunity to leave under his own steam and not under shackles,” she said.
0	Outside the courtroom, Rombot said: “I just want to say thank you to my attorney, my pastor and all of my friends.”
0	The U.S. Attorney’s office is considering an appeal, a spokeswoman said.
0	ICE officials said the arrangement had always been a temporary one and that the agency always had discretion to deport the people covered by the arrangement.
0	The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around the city of Dover in New Hampshire’s seacoast region.
1	Members of the group and advocates say they fear they could face discrimination or violence if forced to return to the world’s largest Muslim-majority country.
0	Their cause has drawn the support of Republican Governor Chris Sununu and New Hampshire’s all-Democratic congressional delegation, including U.S.
0	Senator Jeanne Shaheen.
0	Saris previously ordered a stay to the deportations.
0	She is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.
0	The American Jewish Historical Society Hosts Destroy Israel Event
0	Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.
0	The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.
1	These days it’s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group that defends anti-Semitism and which sponsored talks by an anti-Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood.
0	The fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel.
0	Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?”
0	The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel.
0	He had tweeted, "EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group.
0	Time for US to do same."
1	Kuttab has defended Islamic anti-Semitism by claiming that the “distrust Moslems feel towards Jews” is due to “two acts of betrayal by Jewish tribes against the Prophet.” And that Jews suffer from a “Holocaust Syndrome” of entitlement.
1	He justified hijacking planes, described suicide bombers as “taking the supreme sacrifice” and defended Hezbollah as “an armed-resistance movement”
0	He has claimed that the "Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society" especially in "crucial sectors like banking, finance, media” where "their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers" and that their power strengthens “conspiracy theories about ‘Jewish control’ that are reminiscent of the infamous “’Protocols of the Elders of Zion.’”
0	Robert Herbst and Jonathan Kuttab are both supporters of a one-state plan for eliminating Israel.
0	The American Jewish Historical Society is co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas.
0	An organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel.
0	The “Jewish Homeland” or “Jewish State” argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn’t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country.
0	That worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.
0	The American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.
0	But it’s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History’s headquarters.
0	AJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.
0	And the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.
0	During the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a “JVP Academic Advisory Board Member.” But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.
0	The Balfour event was not AJHS’ only partnership with JVP.
0	In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.
0	Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.
0	His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”.
0	AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.
0	The venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.
0	Specifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.
0	Leo Forchheimer’s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.
0	What would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?
1	A third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism.
0	Efrat has claimed that, "Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews.
0	Being Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism."
0	AJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.
0	But when it comes to Israel, there’s only one perspective.
0	“Balfour” and “Rubble Rubble” are to be part of AJHS’ “1917: How One Year Changed the World”.
0	The exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.
0	But the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.
0	The exhibition closes with Fishback’s anti-Israel agenda.
0	And these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.
0	JVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.
0	The American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.
0	It’s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.
0	Instead it’s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.
0	And it’s no mystery why.
0	The AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.
0	Lila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.
0	Open Hillel seeks to "open" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.
0	Berman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.
0	She signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.
0	Other AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.
0	When we look at what is going on in CJH’s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.
0	Myers is a symptom of the problem.
0	As is AJHS’s partnership with JVP.
0	A great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.
0	Unlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.
1	Its perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic.
0	And yet it’s inescapable.
1	Even as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear.
0	The radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding “moderate” opposing voices into Jewish organizations.
0	Instead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.
0	And it will not be satisfied with anything less.
0	During the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship.
1	Is co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?
0	The anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.
0	And support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.
0	Not when JVP is at AJHS.
1	We all have choices to make.
0	Sometimes the choices are murky.
0	Other times they are simple and easy.
0	When the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy.
1	Either you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.
0	As the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple.
0	But they will not be any less difficult.
0	Opposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.
0	The anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.
0	Speaking out against hate is easiest when it’s weakest.
0	It’s hardest when it’s strongest.
0	When we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out.
0	We don’t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.

0	Trump calls on Sessions to stop Mueller’s Russia probe, raising specter of attempted obstruction
1	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to “stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,” opening the president to further complaints that he is trying to obstruct the investigation into Russia’s election interference and his campaign’s possible complicity.
0	Trump is already reportedly under investigation for potential obstruction of the Russia probe led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
1	The tweet early Wednesday was the president’s most explicit post or statement to date seemingly aimed at getting his attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement officer, to end the probe
1	The tweet, along with several others Wednesday morning, accelerated the president’s attacks on the investigation, which he claims is tainted by bias.
0	They were likely prompted by the start of the trial on Tuesday of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, on 18 charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and conspiracy.
1	“This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.
1	Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!” Trump wrote.
1	The president suggested in a subsequent tweet that Manafort was being treated worse than Al Capone, the notorious Prohibition-era Chicago gangster.
0	“Where is the Russian Collusion?” Trump added.
1	Trump’s tweets prompted Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to accuse the president of obstruction “hiding in plain sight.”
0	“The President of the United States just called on his Attorney General to put an end to an investigation in which the President, his family and campaign may be implicated,” Schiff tweeted.
1	“This is an attempt to obstruct justice hiding in plain sight.
0	America must never accept it.”
0	Although the White House has said that Trump’s tweets are official presidential statements, his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, responded to the latest one as he has before, by brushing off suggestions that Trump’s tweets could be used as evidence of obstruction.
0	“The president was expressing his opinion on his favored medium for asserting his First Amendment right of free speech,” Giuliani said in an interview.
0	“He said ‘should,’ not ‘must,’ and no presidential order was issued or will be.”
0	He said he spoke with Trump to make sure that the president wasn’t actually issuing an order.
0	“I talked to him about it to make sure he was on the same page as we are,” Giuliani said, and the president indicated he was not ordering Sessions to act.
0	On Sunday, Giuliani told CBS’ “Face the Nation”: “Obstruction by tweet is not something I think works real well.
0	Generally obstruction is secret, it’s clandestine, it’s corrupt.”
1	Giuliani added, “I’ve looked at all those tweets and they don’t amount to anything.”
0	For months, Trump’s lawyers also have argued that it’s impossible for the president to obstruct justice because his constitutional authority extends over the Justice Department.
0	That power allows him to direct officials where to focus their resources or to fire them when he chooses, as Trump did when removing James B. Comey as FBI director last year.
0	That firing, however, led to Mueller’s appointment as special counsel.
1	Wednesday’s tweet was a reminder of Trump’s unabated anger at Sessions, who recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation on March 2, 2017 — as members of both parties and legal experts have contended that he should.
1	Sessions pointed to Justice Department regulations to explain that, as one of Trump’s earliest and most active supporters, he shouldn’t participate in the investigation of the Trump campaign.
0	He announced the decision after controversy over his own undisclosed contacts, both during the campaign and the post-election transition, with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey Kislyak.
0	Two months ago, Trump tweeted that he should have chosen a different person as attorney general who wouldn’t have needed to recuse himself.
0	“I wish I did!” he wrote.
0	In his tweets, Trump also quoted criticism of the investigation from Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor who frequently defends Trump on television.
0	In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dershowitz said he does not believe Sessions has the authority to end the probe.
0	“You can’t be both recused and making decisions about the investigation,” he said.
0	But Dershowitz also cast doubt on whether Trump’s tweets can be seen as an act of obstruction.
0	“You cannot obstruct justice by openly exercising your First Amendment rights and openly criticizing a prosecution, whether you’re right or wrong,” he said.
0	“Obstruction of justice is generally committed behind the scenes, so I think both sides are a little overwrought here.”
0	Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, agreed that Sessions cannot stop the Russia investigation given that he recused himself.
1	“The president, intentionally or not, is misdirecting his ire,” Vladeck said.
0	If Trump wanted to use his power to end the probe, he would have to give the order to Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general supervising the Mueller team’s work, and fire Rosenstein if he does not comply, according to Vladeck.
0	Trump could also try to replace Sessions as attorney general with someone who does not have a conflict of interest from the campaign, allowing that person to relieve Rosenstein of the responsibility to oversee Mueller, Vladeck said.

0	Leaked Doc Reveals White House Planning “Regime Change” In Iran
0	This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
0	It appears Rudy Giuliani wasn’t lying.
1	Just a few days after the former NYC mayor and latest member of President Trump’s unexpectedly let it slip that “we got a president who is tough, who does not listen to the people who are naysayers, and a president who is committed to regime change [in Iran]”, the Washington Free Beacon has obtained a three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials with drafted plans to spark regime change in Iran, following the US exit from the Obama-era nuclear deal and the re-imposition of tough sanctions aimed at toppling the Iranian regime.
0	The plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including – who else – National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.
0	The regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton—a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change—entered the White House.
0	It deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian population that has increasingly grown angry at the ruling regime for its heavy investments in military adventurism across the region.
0	–Free Beacon
0	“The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,” SSG writes in the paper.
0	“This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months” it further claims as an argument to push a “regime change” policy.
0	For now – at least – overthrowing the Iran government, with its extensive and close ties to the Kremlin, is not official US policy; SSG president Jim Hanson told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration does not want to engage in direct military intervention in Iran – and is instead focusing on other methods of ridding Iran of its “hardline ruling regime.”
0	“The Trump administration has no desire to roll tanks in an effort to directly topple the Iranian regime,” Hanson said.
0	“But they would be much happier dealing with a post-Mullah government.
0	That is the most likely path to a nuclear weapons-free and less dangerous Iran.”
1	That will likely change, however.
0	One source close to the White House who has previewed the plan told the Free Beacon that the nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, solidified the Iranian regime’s grip on power and intentionally prevented the United States from fomenting regime change
0	“The JCPOA purposefully destroyed the carefully created global consensus against the Islamic Republic,” said the source, who would only speak to the Free Beacon on background about the sensitive issue.
0	“Prior to that, everyone understood the dangers of playing footsie with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.
0	It’s now Trump, Bolton, and [Mike] Pompeo’s job to put this consensus back in place.”
0	The source tells the Beacon that Bolton is “acutely aware of the danger the Iranian regime poses to the region.”
0	“John is someone who understands the danger of Iran viscerally, and knows that you’re never going to fundamentally change its behavior—and the threats against Israel and the Saudis especially—until that revolutionary regime is gone,” the source said, adding that “nothing’s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.”
0	That said, Bolton is confident that an Iranian regime change will occur in the next six months:

1	A second source tells The Beacon that the Trump administration recognizes that the “chief impediment to the region is Iran’s tyrannical regime.”
0	“The problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it’s the Iranian regime,” said the source.
0	“Team Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.
0	President Trump hired him knowing all of that.
1	The administration will now start aggressively moving to deal with the root cause of chaos and violence in the region in a clear-eyed way.”
0	Regional sources who have spoken to SSG “tell us that Iranian social media is more outraged about internal oppression, such as the recent restrictions on Telegram, than about supporting or opposing the nuclear program.
0	Iranian regime oppression of its ethnic and religious minorities has created the conditions for an effective campaign designed to splinter the Iranian state into component parts,” the group states.
0	–Free Beacon
0	“More than one third of Iran’s population is minority groups, many of whom already seek independence,” the paper explains.
0	“U.S.
0	support for these independence movements, both overt and covert, could force the regime to focus attention on them and limit its ability to conduct other malign activities.”
0	Without a regime change, the United States will continue face threats from Iranian forces stationed throughout the region, including in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon.
0	“The probability the current Iranian theocracy will stop its nuclear program willingly or even under significant pressure is low,” the plan states.
1	“Absent a change in government within Iran, America will face a choice between accepting a nuclear-armed Iran or acting to destroy as much of this capability as possible.”
0	That said, President Trump made clear earlier in the week that US officials must make efforts to differentiate between the people of Iran and its ruling regime.
0	“Any public discussion of these options, and any messaging about the Iranian regime in general, should make a bright line distinction between the theocratic regime along with its organs of oppression and the general populace,” according to the plan.
0	“We must constantly reinforce our support for removing the iron sandal from the necks of the people to allow them the freedom they deserve.”

0	(Tallahassee) Project Veritas Action Fund has released undercover video from Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum’s campaign, revealing his election strategy includes making empty promises to voters.
0	This is the seventh undercover video report Project Veritas has released in a series revealing secrets and lies from political campaigns in 2018.
0	Said James O’Keefe, founder and president of Project Veritas Action:
1	“What we found in the Gillum campaign was just what we found in Missouri, Tennessee and Arizona, a candidate lying to the voters he needs to win the election.”
1	Gillum campaign makes promises it knows it can’t keep
0	Featured in this report is a campaign staffer who works on Andrew Gillum’s gubernatorial campaign.
1	Omar Smith, who says he went to college with Gillum, reveals Gillum cannot fulfill his campaign promises even if he wanted to.
1	When asked how Gillum would fund all the programs he says he wants to fund, Smith says Gillum “can’t,” and when asked if voters are aware that Gillum cannot deliver on his proposed programs, Smith says:
0	SMITH: “That’s not for them to know… That’s not for them to know.
0	Remember our saying, modern day fairy tales start with ‘once I am elected.
0	'”
1	Smith explains that most of Gillum’s campaign promises could never be implemented, and that the Gillum campaign knows this:
0	SMITH: “So, let’s go back to Mr. Gillum’s platform, right?
0	Raise the corporate tax in Florida from 7 to 11 percent.
0	That will never happen.
0	Raise teacher’s pay to $50,000, that will never happen.
0	Give me another position.
1	Medicare for all, that will never happen.
0	The reason being, the legislature that write the bills is all Republican controlled.
0	Democratic governor, Republican legislature.
0	So, unless the legislature writes a bill, and it got voted on the floor, it cannot pass.”
1	Smith says that “the rules in Florida are f***ed up” and that Florida is a “cracker state,” explaining that the Florida legislature has to become racially black for Gillum’s agenda to advance.
1	“Whip up” the poor into a “frenzy in order for them to vote.”
1	Smith says that in order to get voters on board with Gillum’s fairy tale platform, the campaign must “whip” lower income individuals “into a frenzy.”
1	SMITH: “You whip ’em up.
0	The poor, the middle income.
1	You have to whip them up into a frenzy in order for them to vote.
0	Once Gillum is in, in another 2 years, other Republican Senators and Legislators will be on the ballot.
1	So, you have to whip up the Andrew Gillum voters again in those counties to vote out the Republican to get a Democratic Legislature in order for his (Gillum) will to be executed.”
1	Smith adds that because not all Democratic voters are the same, that the Gillum campaign needs to appeal to “white guilt” to turn out the vote:
1	SMITH: “You have to appeal to white guilt… [be]cause that’s what it is.”
0	Smith also explains that the Gillum campaign can’t let voters know what Gillum’s true agenda is before election day:
0	SMITH: “… We don’t, do we have to let [the voters] know what the agenda is ahead of time?
0	We can’t… We cannot… You alienate everybody.
0	Then you get painted like, oh, Gillum is being painted, no.
1	You are a socialist, you are way out of left field…”
1	Gillum is a “crazy, crazy,” Democrat
1	Smith also explains Gillum’s political worldview, saying that “Gillum is a progressive… He is a part of the crazy crazy crazies.”
1	Cliff Eserman, who works for the Broward County Democratic Party adds that during the Democratic primary, Gillum had to campaign on values he does not really believe:
1	ESERMAN: “In order to win he had to be… He’s really left of center.
1	So he was being left, not left of center… For the primary.
1	Now [in the general] he’s going back to left of center.”
0	Dale Holeness, who is the Broward County Commissioner and also works on Gillum’s campaign, explains Gillum’s gun control views:
0	HOLENESS: “There ought to be at least a three-day waiting period for everybody and a full background check for everybody… And we need to- And these automatic guns with sixteen rounds a minute, they ought to not be on the streets either, so that’s his plan.”
0	Adrian Young, who works for the Florida Democratic Party also elaborates on Gillum’s gun control views in the report:
0	YOUNG: “… I do think he’s not saying specifically like I’m going to ban bump stocks or I’m against ATs, only because he’s running a race right now.
1	I do think he would support anybody doing that stuff, Bill Nelson… But I don’t think he can say it just [be]cause he’s trying to get the moderates and the gun-toting people in North Florida…”

1	Evidence shows Pope Francis is a ‘principal in a cover-up’ of clergy sex-abuse in Chile: Expert
0	NewsCatholic Church
1	WASHINGTON, D.C., February 12, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Those familiar with Jorge Bergoglio in Argentina before he became Pope Francis say it is a “classic” move of his to provide “mercy” to clergy who are sexual predators while asking everybody else to simply “move on,” said attorney and child advocate Elizabeth Yore on an EWTN show last week.
0	“I think this is a misplaced mercy.
1	It is mercy for the predator priests,” she told EWTN’s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over.
1	“There are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,” she added.
0	(See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below)
0	Yore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.
0	The Pope’s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.
1	“The Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,” Yore said during the interview.
0	Yore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was “told from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.”
0	“The Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.
0	He received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,” she said.
0	As details continue to surface, the pontiff’s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well.
1	Yore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros “a scandal of epic proportions.”
0	The scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.
0	Yore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information “extremely dangerous.”
1	“But it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church — you know, the last appeal — that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] ‘Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?’”
0	Reports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.
0	The alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.
0	Pope Francis received the victim’s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis’s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope’s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.
1	Francis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest “calumny.”
1	While Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are “slander.”
0	The Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna – the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.
0	Expectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission.
0	And while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don’t match his tough stances on abuse.
0	Four members of the commission had met with Cardinal O’Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis’s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.
0	It was at the meeting with O’Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O’Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.
0	Yore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops’ conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored.
0	Further, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified — including the letter’s author Juan Carlos — to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.
1	Arroyo spoke with Cruz as well, who said he was “incredibly frustrated” when Barros was going to be appointed.
1	He’d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse, he said, but Barros had special significance for him because Barros’ part went beyond witnessing the abuse, to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation.
0	Cruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.
0	And he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O’Malley.
0	Cruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope’s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.
0	“To hear him talk about us that way,” Cruz said, “calling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.”
0	Scicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.
0	“This leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,” Yore said.
1	“Here we have victims 10, 15 years after their abuse, begging the Pope, having to take pictures of a letter that’s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the Pope is receiving this information.”
1	The whole of Latin America, including Argentina, was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in Chile in 2010, Yore noted, and yet the Pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information.
1	This was precisely what he’d been saying when he was cardinal and archbishop in Buenos Aires, she said, that no one ever came forward with information, and there were never any cases of clerical abuse in the entirety of the two-million-plus member Archdiocese of Buenos Aires.
1	“This isn’t just simply a cover-up of a predator priest,” Yore stated.
0	“This is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.”
0	She said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.
0	“So I don’t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,” she said.
1	“This is also sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang, a predator priest.
1	This is why it is so heinous.”
0	Yore said that given the Church’s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees.
0	There are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up, Yore told Arroyo, maybe even some even worse than the Barros case.
1	“Those cases are going to be haunting this papacy and really causing a rift in the major protection of children that Pope Benedict had worked very hard to really build up,” she said.
0	“Trust within the faithful and to put in a system that was going to root out the predators.
0	And I think that has just been blown up and I think we are back to square one in the Vatican."
1	Texas Mom: My Son Was Attacked For Wearing A MAGA Hat At Whataburger
1	A Texas mother’s teenage son was allegedly attacked at a Whataburger for wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat.
0	The mother posted the video of the incident on Facebook as evidence of her claims.
1	The woman claimed a man became extremely angry at her teenage son and his group of friends because one of them wore a “Make American Great Again” hat, KENS5 reported.
0	The hats have become noticeable and are often an outward expression of support of President Donald Trump.
1	The video shows the man throwing his fountain drink at the table and shouting a racial slur.
1	According to Breitbart, in the mother’s post on Facebook, which has since been taken down, Patricia Spittler asks for help in identifying the man she called “scum bag of the year.” The San Antonio CBS affiliate reported that Spittler wrote: “His friend was wearing a patriotic hat, and this happened!
1	It would be nice to know who he is for someone to let him know his actions are not okay!” Spittler added: “Real tough guy… approaches a group of teenagers minding their own business just having a burger!
0	He kept his hat, too.”
0	The video found it’s way to Twitter, and it is slightly violent, so err on the side of caution if watching near children.
0	Also be aware that there a few racial slurs in the video.

0	As the video begins, the man says, “… supporting the president.
1	You ain’t supporting shit nigga,” and then throws the drink in the face of a 16-year-old boy.
1	With MAGA hat in hand, the man walks away saying “Bitch ass motherf**ker.”
0	The boy, Hunter Richard, said the man also pulled his hair while taking the hat, according to reports by News4SA.
1	“I support my President and if you don’t, let’s have a conversation about it instead of ripping my hat off.
0	I just think a conversation about politics is more productive for the entire whole rather than taking my hat and yelling subjective words to me,” he told the local NBC affiliate.
1	A police report was filed and a man was fired for stealing the hat and the assault (throwing a drink in a Trump supporter’s face.)
0	The post below, claiming a person was fired for the actions against Richard, had been removed or made private, meaning some may not see it.
0	House of Representatives Paid $15,000,000 To Sexual Harassment Victims
0	Did you know that the House of Representatives has paid out $15,000,000 to victims of sexual harassment in recent years?
1	I am going to share some things with you in this article that are deeply disturbing, but it is for a purpose.
1	The status quo is not acceptable in Washington, and once people truly understand how deep the corruaption runs I believe that they will get motivated to finally drain the swamp once and for all.
1	So yes, I am going to share some things in this article that are truly disgusting, but the goal is to show you that it is time to take our government back from the corrupt career politicians that are completely and utterly out of control.
0	In recent days, CNN has interviewed dozens of people that worked on Capitol Hill, and almost every single one of them had stories of sexual harassment to share…
0	CNN spoke with more than 50 lawmakers, current and former Hill aides and political veterans who have worked in Congress, the majority of whom spoke anonymously to be candid and avoid potential repercussions.
0	With few exceptions, every person said they have personally experienced sexual harassment on the Hill or know of others who have.
1	In an environment with “so many young women,” said one ex-House aide, the men “have no self-control.” “Amongst ourselves, we know,” a former Senate staffer said of the lawmakers with the worst reputations.
1	And sometimes, the sexual advances from members of Congress or senior aides are reciprocated in the hopes of advancing one’s career — what one political veteran bluntly referred to as a “sex trade on Capitol Hill.”
1	The American people are not going to put up with this any longer.
1	We have no choice but to clean up our government because the rest of the world is laughing at us.
0	On Tuesday, U.S. Representative Jackie Speier told a congressional hearing that she personally knows of two current members of Congress that have “engaged in sexual harassment”…
1	“In fact there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, right now, who serve — who have…engaged in sexual harassment.” Speier said one of the harassers has propositioned women with the comment, “Are you going to be a good girl?” Another has exposed his genitals, she said, and some victims have had “their private parts grabbed on the House floor.” “All they ask in return as staff members is to be able to work in a hostile-free work environment.
0	They want the system fixed and the perpetrators held accountable.”
0	And Speier was the one that revealed the fact that 15 million dollars have been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House in recent years.
0	The following comes from Breitbart…
0	Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily on Tuesday that the U.S. House of Representatives has paid $15 million to alleged victims of sexual harassment by its own members in recent years.
0	“We do know there is about $15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last ten to 15 years,” she said.
0	“15 million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims,” Todd replied, somewhat shocked.
0	“So, obviously more than one member of Congress.”
0	If members of Congress are engaged in this type of behavior, why don’t the American people know about it?
0	And why are those members of Congress still allowed to serve?
0	Representative Barbara Comstock also testified on Tuesday.
1	She said that one current member of Congress exposed his private parts to a female staffer when she delivered papers to his house…
0	Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) said at a House Administration Committee hearing on Tuesday that a sitting member of the U.S. Congress exposed himself to a young female staffer who delivered papers to his house–at his request.
0	We need to be told who this member of Congress is so that he can be removed from Congress immediately.
1	This kind of behavior is not acceptable for anyone in a civilized society – and that goes double for someone that is supposed to be one of the leaders of our nation.
0	Here are the exact words that Comstock used as she described this incident…
0	This member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials, to their residence.
0	And the young staffer — it was a young woman — went there and was greeted with a member in a towel.
0	It was a male, who then invited her in.
0	And at that point, he decided to expose himself.
0	She left, and then she quit her job.
1	She left, she found another job.
0	Of course, this sort of behavior is not just limited to members of Congress.
1	According to an ex-Secret Service agent, Vice-President Joe Biden was regularly engaged in “Weinstein-level” predatory behavior…
1	An ex-Secret Service agent is claiming that former Vice President Joe Biden engaged in “Weinstein-level” sexual assault and that he would walk around the VP residence late at night completely naked.
1	According to Big League Politics’ Cassandra Fairbanks, a Secret Service agent who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed that Biden “would mess with every single woman or teen,” and that a Christmas get-together at the VP’s house had to be canceled “because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend’s asses.”
0	In fact, things were so bad that at one point a Secret Service agent almost got into a fight with Biden.
0	Here is more from Paul Joseph Watson…
0	During one alleged incident in 2009, Biden cupped the breast of a Secret Service agent’s girlfriend during a photo, prompting the agent to shove Biden and almost hit him.
0	The agent was subsequently suspended for a week, according to the source.
0	Men would often stand in front of female agents and Navy women or create false pretenses to have them leave the room just to get them away from Biden, according to the agent.
0	When I am elected to Congress, I am going to make fighting this sort of predatory behavior a top priority.
1	We are supposed to serve as an example to the rest of the world, and instead, we have become a bad joke.
1	Those that have been engaging in this sort of shameful behavior have got to go because we simply are not going to put up with it anymore.

1	How often I see and hear the professors of Christianity today walking contrary to the word and spirit of the Living Christ (2 Corinthians 3:6).
1	How willing they are to overlook judgment when it comes to the criminals that run rampant in this country, and on the other hand how willing they are to show compassion to the criminals while overlooking the victims.
0	Why?

0	This is exactly the Scriptural point that I want to make.
0	From the pulpits in America today we here the events unfold of Sodom and Gomorra and how Abraham should have prayed longer in hopes that God would have spared them rather than the righteous people in Sodom and Gomorra doing what God had commanded.
0	And of course, not a second thought on man's behalf is given concerning the victims in these two cities.
0	Here is Abraham’s account…
0	“And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
0	And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
0	For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
0	And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
0	And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.
1	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
1	Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
1	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
1	And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
1	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?
0	And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
0	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.
0	And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
0	And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.
0	And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
0	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.
0	And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
0	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.
0	And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
0	And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place."
0	-Genesis 18:16-33
0	Got questions.org explains very well…
0	Genesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah.
0	Lot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.
0	The angels agreed.
0	The Bible then informs us, "Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom — both young and old — surrounded the house.
0	They called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?
1	Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.
0	Genesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.
1	Lot and his family flee the city, and then "the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah — from the LORD out of the heavens.
0	Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities..." (Genesis 19:2 4) .
0	In light of the passage, the most common response to the question, "What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?"
0	is that it was homosexuality.
0	That is how the term ”sodomy” came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.
0	Clearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.
1	The men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels, who were disguised as men.
0	At the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
0	The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.
0	Ezekiel 16:49-50 declares, "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.
1	They were haughty and did detestable things before me..." The Hebrew word translated "detestable" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an "abomination."
1	Similarly, Jude 7 declares, "...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion."
0	So, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.
0	Those who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.
0	The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.
1	There is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape.
0	But to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.
1	While Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants.
0	To this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland.
1	Sodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.
1	The point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it.
1	Question: How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities (Jonah 2:4) and refuse to return to the Lord (Jeremiah 6:16) on His terms?
0	(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.
0	Men today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth.
0	They are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).
0	They care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).
0	Men today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through “antinomianism” than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).
0	Instead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.
1	They care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares (Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord (Luke 16:15).
0	They wear the cross.
0	Yet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: “Deny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me” (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).
1	Professed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18).
0	They read what to do, but do it not!
0	In fact, they declare and proclaim how much they love God, and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives, they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions (Matthew 15:8).
0	Then again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out "Crucify him!
0	Crucify him!
0	We have no king but Caesar" (John 19:15).
0	And these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).
0	They continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4).
0	Today, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times.
0	They declare we're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord's commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).
1	Ungrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are (Matthew 23:3).
1	Instead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here.
0	Instead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states, they teach them to just do their best to understand that they cannot help themselves while God say’s the opposite (Leviticus 20:18).
1	Instead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them, they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down.
0	And instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies (Proverbs 6:17), they merely pass it off as a "choice," that being the lessons that they learned from the media that they say that they do not believe (Romans 1:18).
1	The American Church, instead of protesting corruption in government through the example of the Biblical patriarchs and our American forefathers (Matthew 5:17-18), teach to submit to tyranny as if to suggest that it is somehow obedience to God (Romans 12:21).
1	The Church in America has failed to keep the Commandments of the God of Israel.
1	Instead of preaching out against sin, they advocate for that which God clearly condemns, thereby making war against God (Micah 3:5), which at length destroys our government, our country and our families.
0	Look to their feigned strength that they profess to possess.
1	It is gauged by simply looking to the prevailing immoralities and debauchers of society.
1	They are weak and pathetic and they have no excuses as to why America is where we is today!
0	Why did God judge Sodom and Gomorrah?
1	It's the same reason that he is judging America today (Amos 4:12), He cannot find the righteous in order to spare her (Jeremiah 22:3).
1	Defining the Wicked…
1	Wicked men in the sight of God are those who have the knowledge of what to do when it comes to the right, but over and over again, they turn their shoulders and choose the wrong, through tolerance and apathy Americans are bringing upon themselves destruction (Deuteronomy 30:19) that will not be reversed, which leaves no alternative as to why God judges and is judging America today (Deuteronomy 28:63).

1	Mueller is ‘looking for trouble,’ Trump says cryptically
1	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump continued bashing Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is “looking for trouble.”
1	Trump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is “Disgraced and discredited,” claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a “group of Angry Democrat Thugs.”
1	That came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a “gang.” Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base.
0	The president’s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day.
0	Trump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president’s personal attorney.
1	But Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for “over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.” (The tweet included a misspelling of “counsel.”)
1	The length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is “looking for trouble” because they “they know there is no Russian Collusion.”
0	But Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
1	The session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting.
0	As Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer.
1	The president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a “phony crime.” He’s right, there is no specific collusion statute.
1	But legal experts say anyone in Trump’s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice.
0	All are federal crimes.
1	Trump also continued to cast himself as a victim in the matter, saying when he attempts to “FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,” his critics “scream Obstruction!”
0	Mueller also is looking at whether some of Trump’s actions like firing then-FBI Director James B. Comey or statements about the Russia probe since taking office amount to an attempt to interfere illegally with the special counsel probe.

0	Muslim Cleric: “There Were Jews In Islamic Countries & Caliphates, But We Never Killed Them Just For Being Jews”
1	When he says that Muslims never killed Jews just for being Jews, he is lying, and relying on the historical ignorance of his audience.
1	In my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , I detail many instances in which Muslims did exactly that.
1	In 1013, Berbers from North Africa entered Spain and took Córdoba in 1013, they began massacring Jews, and initiated a wholesale slaughter of Jews in Granada.
1	And again in 1066, rioting Muslims, enraged by the humiliation of a Jew who had been appointed to rule over Muslims, murdered four thousand Jews in Granada.

1	Kuwaiti cleric Sheikh Jihad Al-‘Ayesh delivered a speech in which he said that the figure of six million Jews killed in the Holocaust was a “historical lie,” but that Hitler “knew the truth about the Jews” and therefore began “tormenting and persecuting them.” “The Jews were banished, tortured and annihilated because of their deeds.
0	They were not banished for being Jews,” he said.
0	In an effort to dispute the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, Sheikh Al-‘Ayesh, who heads the Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center, drew the following analogy: “Imagine that you want to build a bakery.
0	What size of bakery would you need to make 10,000 loaves of bread?… What if you wanted to make 50,000 loaves of bread an hour?
0	You would need a larger bakery.
0	How many ovens would you need to burn six million human beings?” Sheikh Al-‘Ayesh’s posted his address on his personal YouTube channel on May 26.
0	The video was also posted on the Facebook account of Bait Al-Maqdis Documentary Studies Center.
0	Following is a transcript: Jihad Al-‘Ayesh: “Some people have shown up with a new fashion.
1	We used to think that fashion has to do with haircuts, clothes, or lifestyle, but the vogue today is to sympathize with the Jews and to shed crocodile tears about their sorrows, their heresy, and their historical lies.
1	This is, indeed, a new fashion.
1	Some esteemed people shed tears about what the Jews call ‘the Holocaust.’ […] “Did the Nazi annihilation – the Holocaust – target only the Jews?
0	Anybody?
1	The Jews claim that it happened to them alone and that the number of Jews who died in that Holocaust was six million.
0	What we have here are historical errors.
1	First of all, the figure of six million is a historical lie.
1	In addition, claiming that it happened to the Jews alone excludes the non-Jews who were tortured by Hitler.
1	So was it annihilation?
0	Yes, it was.
1	Who did Hitler annihilate?
1	He annihilated a group of races and people, some of whom were even German.
1	Hitler annihilated 400,000 Germans who were handicapped or suffered from chronic diseases.
1	Hitler did not annihilate the Jews only.
0	[…] “Hitler was not the first in the West to perpetrate a genocide.
1	Inhuman and criminal annihilation runs in the veins of many in the West.

1	[…] “Was there annihilation?
0	Yes.
1	Many races were annihilated.
1	The Auschwitz camp, which is in southern Poland, was a major and exceptional camp for detention, torture, and forced labor.
0	Many people were tortured and were starved to death there.

0	There were Jews in the Islamic countries and caliphates as well, but we never killed them just for being Jews.

0	US embassy worker in China suffers 'brain injury' amid 'sonic attack' fears
1	A US embassy worker in China has reported experiencing "abnormal sensations of sounds and pressure" amid fears of a "sonic attack".
0	The state department has issued a health alert to its citizens in the country, adding that the unnamed staff member's symptoms indicate a "mild traumatic brain injury".
0	The findings echo similar reports that caused the US to recall non-essential embassy staff from Cuba in 2017, after at least 24 US citizens suffered symptoms indicating they had been deliberately and covertly targeted.
1	US investigators are looking into whether the employee in China has been affected by a "sonic attack", which was one of the theories behind the still-unexplained illnesses suffered in Havana.
0	The unnamed government worker was based in the southeast port city of Guangzhou, where an American consulate is based.
0	He has now been flown back to the US for assessment, according to reports.
1	The state department has issued a health alert to its staff in China, which states: "While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source.
0	"Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present."
0	Image: US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is set to meet with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday
1	The embassy in Beijing said it could not link the case in China to the health issues suffered by its staff in Cuba.
0	In an email to citizens in China, the state department said: "A US government employee in China recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.
0	"The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event."
0	They added that they are not sure what has caused the employee's symptoms.
0	The US Secretary of Mike Pompeo has said he is concerned about the "serious health incident" that has affected an embassy worker in Guangzhou.
0	China's foreign ministry and national health commission did not immediately respond to questions about the findings, the Associated Press reported.
1	The US reduced its workforce in Havana, Cuba, in 2017 after its personnel and their families reported experiencing a range of health issues.
1	Investigators have drawn theories including that were targeted by sonic attacks, where the symptoms included dizziness, headaches and vomiting.
1	The attacks can sometimes be carried out by emitting "infrasounds", which are low frequency noises that can affect human hearing if they are loud enough.
1	However, Dr Toby Heys told the New Scientist in 2017 that an infrasound attack wouldn't be "very covert" as a "large array of subwoofers" would be needed.

1	The other type is an "ultrasound" attack, whereby a high frequency noise inaudible to human ears can be targeted easily at potential victims.
1	They can damage parts of the ear such as hairs that pick up sounds, but again it is reported that large equipment would be needed for such an attack.
1	Other theories behind the health issues in Cuba include the use of electromagnetic weapons, which can target highly-focused energy at potential victims.
0	This can include a laser, microwaves, or particle beams.
0	Investigators also speculated that a flawed spy device could be behind the victims' ailments in Cuba.
1	The US expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the US after the alleged acoustic attacks.

1	Biblical Illiterates Reverse Romans 13: Teach Submit to Tyranny!
0	Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the first his Cromwell; And George the third- Treason!

1	Recently, I received a newspaper article from a confused, biblically illiterate friend asking me what my take was on an article titled, “Scripture teaches to submit to authorities” with reference to Romans Chapter 13.
1	In this article, the author was calling out a Christian for protesting a corrupt representative in government, even going so far as to suggest this protestant ought to have stayed home to read their Bible rather than to protest corruption in government.
0	He went onto say that we are commanded by Scripture to submit to the authorities that have been elected.
0	To start off, maybe this individual should take the time to know a little bit of his own history!
0	There is nothing worse than when a person who doesn’t know what they are talking about tries to tell you what the truth is.

1	Maybe he should have taken the time to look to the founding forefathers and that document which they drew up called “The Declaration of Independence.” That document alone is 75% of the usurpations that the Tyrant King George committed against our forefathers and what it is that our forefathers would not put up with.
1	Our American history found in that document teaches that our forefathers threw off the tyrant that would not be ruled by God and declared “Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God!"
1	Furthermore, the motto of the American Revolution was “No King but King Jesus.” America’s original national seal was “REBELLION TO TYRANTS IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD” with a picture on the inside of the seal showing the Pharaoh being overthrown by the sea with Moses and the children of Israel safe on the shore.
1	John Hancock, the first signer of the Declaration of Independence, said,
0	“Resistance to tyranny becomes the Christian duty of each individual… Continue steadfast and, with a proper sense of your dependence on God, nobly defend those rights which Heaven gave, and no man ought to take from us.” (History of the United States of America, Volume.
0	2 p. 229)
1	Apparently, this individual who wrote the article knows nothing of the Black Robed Regiment that the tyrant King George feared the most.
1	The Black Robed regiment, were in fact, the preachers that went before the Forefathers in educating the colonies to resistance when it came to the corrupt King on the other side of the pond.
0	They sacrificed themselves to establish the freedoms in which he enjoys today.
1	The author went on to write that this protestant should know what the Bible says about those in authority.
0	First of all, the authority given to our representative government is derived from “We the People.”
0	We receive our rights from God, and in turn, delegate power to those who serve “We the People.”
1	Representatives work for us, we do not work for them.
0	“They are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights… Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed.” -The Declaration of Independence
0	He then quotes Romans 13: 1-7
0	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
0	For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
1	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
0	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.
0	Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?
0	do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:
0	For he is the minister of God to thee for good.
1	But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
0	Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
0	For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
0	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
0	The first Scripture says:
0	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
0	For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
0	God ordained the power, and that “rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil."
0	Did God tell His Church to submit to that which He condemns?
1	(Deuteronomy 25:1; Proverbs 17:15) Absolutely not!
0	Is the Church to transgress His Laws, or to magnify and enforce His Laws unto judgment?
1	(Psalm 40:8; Romans 3:31) Of course not!
0	If He did, that would make God unjust.
0	Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil” (Matthew 5:17).
0	The Lord has, in fact, commanded nowhere in Scripture for the Church to submit to the wicked.
0	The Bible teaches just the exact opposite.
1	We are to “have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them” (Ephesians 5:11).
0	Furthermore, it would contradict what Scripture teaches us from Genesis all the way to Revelation every step of the way.
1	Think of this: Those that serve “We the People,” before taking office, swear to uphold the US Constitution with their hand on the Holy Bible.
0	They are appointed to magnify law against crime, not crime against the law (Psalm 94:20).
0	America is based on Common Law, the Mosaic Institution.
0	Read the 5 books of Moses.
1	“No enactment of man can be considered law unless it conforms to the Law of God.” –William Blackstone, English Common Law
1	Representatives are to magnify the law, not tear it down; and yet, this is what the biblically illiterate are teaching others to do, submit to the tyrants and resist God, His Church and His Word (Micah 3:5).
1	I ask, are Christians to submit to those who have sanctioned the murder of the innocent in the womb (Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 6:17)?
1	Absolutely not!
1	Are Christians to submit to those who have redefined marriage where a man can now "marry" a man and a woman can now "marry" a woman (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:24 etc…)?
1	Absolutely not!
1	Submit to those who lie continuously, to them that steal and even kill?
1	Absolutely not!
0	Submit to what God condemns?
1	Yet, this is what the perverse, modern-day, professing Christians are teaching the sheep in the American Church today.
1	It would do you well to now look to the Christ when He said that we are to beware of the leaven of the Pharisee’s (corrupt doctrines of those who claimed to be the children of God), as well as the leaven of Herod (corrupt doctrines of government) (Mark 8:15).
1	If you remember, it was those same people who called for the crucifixion of Christ while crying out “We have no King but Caesar” (John 19:15).
1	Do these that teach such heresy not realize that every apostle, except John, was killed by hostile corrupt civil authorities opposed to their endeavors?
1	Christians throughout history were imprisoned, tortured, or killed by corrupt civil authorities of all stripes for refusing to submit to their various, lawless policies and prohibitions.
0	Did Christian martyrs violate God’s principles of submission to authority?
1	Of course, not.
0	Also, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters.
1	Take note that civil government is to be, and must be, a “terror to good works.” It has no power or authority to terrorize good works or good, law-abiding people.
0	God never gave them that authority and any, and all, government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection.
0	Civil government is a “minister for God to thee for good” (Romans 13:4).
0	It is not a minister of God for evil.
1	Civil magistrates have a divine duty to “execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” Anyone who teaches that they have authority to execute wrath upon "him that doeth good” is ignorant and uneducated in their misleadings (1 John 4:6).
1	To tell Christians to submit to evil civil authority is teaching the opposite of what is true.
0	Common sense does come into play here.
1	I ask, did Moses violate God's principle of submission when he was commanded by God, “Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me” (Exodus 9:1).
0	And when Pharaoh refused, God plagued the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and set His children free.
1	Think of this, the meekest man alive was sent to the face of the Pharaoh to tell him to obey or else.
0	Is this what is being preached from the pulpits across America today?
0	Or what of Gideon who was to deliver the Children of Israel from the Midianites?
0	The first thing the Lord commanded him to do was to tear down his father's altars (Judges 6:25).
0	Was this a violation of God's principles of submission?
0	The sins of the fathers were the reason the Midianites had power to oppress them.
0	What of that lone prophet, Elijah?
1	The tyrant Ahab called him the troubler of Israel.
1	Elijah set the record straight when he answered, "I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim (1 Kings 18:18).
1	Is this a violation of God's principles when it came to submission to authority?
0	Elijah took Ahab and the false prophets to the top of Mount Carmel where the God of Israel consumed the sacrifice by fire, and the false prophets were killed (1 Kings 18:38-40).
0	What of King David?
0	Was he violating God’s principles of submission when he refused to surrender himself to Saul’s troops?
0	David was a king that was to overthrow corrupt governments by dispossessing them and establishing righteousness through justice and judgment (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 51:4).
0	Did Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego violate God's principle of submission when they refused to worship King Nebuchadnezzar’s image?
0	Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
1	Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
0	That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:
1	And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
0	Daniel 3:3-6
1	When they refused to submit to the tyrant, the furnace was heated up 7 times hotter so that the guards were consumed, only to have the fourth man, “like the Son of man,” show up to deliver them where the fire had no power over them, and not a hair of their heads was singed.
1	In the end, Only the corrupt king acknowledges the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
0	“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.” Daniel 3:28
0	Did Daniel violate God's principles of submission when he disobeyed the king's order to stop praying to any god but himself?
0	Keep in mind that the punishment was that Daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which God sent forth an angel to protect him.
0	His accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured Daniel (Daniel 6).
0	What of Jeremiah?
0	Was he violating God's principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings?
0	For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
0	Jeremiah 1:18
1	Don’t forget about Amos, who was prophesying judgment upon the corrupt priests and the corrupt king of his day (Amos 7:10-16).
0	Was that violating, or fulfilling God's principles and purposes?
0	What of the New Testament?
1	John the Baptist points out all of the evils of King Herod (Luke 3:19).
0	Was this a violation of submission to civil government?
0	No, it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and His laws.
0	Is it a violation of submission to God's principles to keep preaching, “Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins…”?
1	Absolutely not!
1	The corrupt Pharisees along with corrupt government did the opposite.
0	“Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
0	And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
0	Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.
0	And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
0	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?
0	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,
1	If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
0	Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
0	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
0	Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
1	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
0	And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
0	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
0	Saying, What shall we do to these men?
0	for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
0	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
0	And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
0	But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.
0	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” Acts 4:2-20
1	Or what of the account found in Acts 12:1-11, where the Lord sent an Angel to liberate Peter from the hands of tyrants.
0	“Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.
0	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
0	And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.
0	(Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
0	And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.
0	Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.
0	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
0	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.
0	And his chains fell off from his hands.
0	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.
0	And so he did.
0	And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
0	And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
0	When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
0	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.”
1	Over and over again, you can see that the Church was to stand in protest against the wicked that were at war with Christ (Revelation 12:17), in dealing with not only the corrupt and wicked priests, but also the corrupt and wicked in government.
0	as well as those who submitted to such.
0	It is important for people to know the Scriptures (History), lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39).
0	Nowhere in Scripture can you find the Lord telling His children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to His Word.
1	Nowhere!
1	Furthermore, the individual that wrote the article teaching people to submit to authorities might want to take the time to read Romans 12:21 before perverting and twisting Romans 13, so that the next time he will not be guilty of twisting Scripture the way that Satan twists Scripture.
0	“Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.”

1	Down in San Antonio, Texas the dangerous and violent predilections of the left reared its ugly head once again.
1	A “man” attacked a teenager who was wearing a #MAGA hat.
1	The criminal attacker, one Kino Jimenez, took the boy’s hat, yelled at him, and then threw a drink in the boy’s face before walking off (and stealing

0	The attack took place in a Whataburger restaurant, and the corporation was quick to condemn the man’s actions:
0	“We were shocked to see this video and certainly don’t condone this type of customer behavior in our restaurants.
0	To be clear, no Whataburger employees were involved or witnessed the incident, and we ask that questions be directed to San Antonio PD as we continue supporting their efforts.”
0	Jimenez, who is 30, seems to have only had a part-time job.
0	His employer was a San Antonio nightspot called Rumble.
1	Immediately upon learning of the altercation, the bar announced that it had fired Jimenez because they believed such behavior was immoral, uncalled for, and not in keeping with Rumble’s welcoming personality.
0	On their Facebook page, they wrote, “…We have since terminated this employee, as his actions go against everything that this establishment stands for.
0	Rumble has, and always will be, a bar that is as inclusive as any establishment could possibly be.
1	THIS BAR IS A SAFE SPACE FOR EVERYONE!
0	No matter your race, creed, ethnicity, sexual identity, and political stance, you are welcomed here!” Rumble said on Facebook that Jimenez worked as a “part-time door guy.” They added, “We do not condone these types of actions or behavior.
0	If you have any questions or concerns please message us privately.
0	We support and appreciate your business.”
1	Contrary to what you might believe about Jimenez… he is/was NOT a Democrat!
0	No, he is further to the Left and was an active member of the Green Party.
0	However, upon learning of his behavior the local Green Party told the media that Jimenez had been cut off from the party for his uncalled for attack on a child.
1	“We all have different opinions of our president, but we don’t take it out on innocent kids who just happen to have a hat on,” Gavino Zarate, secretary of the Harris County Green Party told Heavy.
0	“You may not like the hat or you may not like the president, but you don’t show that kind of aggression toward teenagers.
0	It goes against everything the Green Party stands for.
1	We are not violent.
0	We do not take our aggression out on innocent young people.”
0	Some on the right have connected the attack to Maxine Waters’ call for Democrats to confront members of the Trump administration whenever, and wherever they happened to find them.
0	Leftists have said the connection is unfair, because Waters’ was only calling for accosting Trump administration officials.
0	My question is; how big of a leap would it be for a normal, rational adult to go from confronting administration officials to attacking the people who elected them to power?
0	Not much in my mind.
1	The reality is that the Democrats are as much to blame for the corrosive and ugly rhetoric in America today as Donald Trump is.

0	Pope Francis' sexual abuse commission, hit by resignations and criticism, gets a reboot
0	Last week Pope Francis announced he was reviving a panel he created to advise the Vatican on how to handle sexual abuse by clergy.
0	The issue has dogged the Roman Catholic Church in recent years, and critics have accused Francis and his two predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, of failing to aggressively weed out and punish predator priests.
0	Here’s a look what drove the panel’s creation and what to expect in the future.
0	What is Pope Francis’ commission on sexual abuse?
0	Following criticism he was not focusing on halting child abuse within the church, Francis created the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors in March 2014, naming Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, to run it.
0	O’Malley was not only a member of the pope’s “G9” group of close advisors; he was also the man who sought to clean up the abuse scandal in Boston after the departure of his predecessor, Cardinal Bernard Law, whose shifting of predator priests to new posts was exposed by the Boston Globe and chronicled in the movie “Spotlight.”
0	The revelations about Law, who died in December, emboldened abuse victims across the country and world, who began speaking up about the priests who had molested them.
0	When he created the commission, Francis said: “The commission’s specific task is to propose to me the most opportune initiatives for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.”
0	Why is it being renewed now?
0	After the commission’s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy.
0	O’Malley returns as chief.
0	New members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, "reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,” the Vatican said.
0	What did the first commission achieve?
0	The Vatican has said it “worked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.”
0	What didn’t it do?
0	Commission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.
0	Even if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests’ behavior, those strictures were not enough, O’Malley said in 2014.
0	“There are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,” he said.
1	The commission was behind Francis’ decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years.
0	But amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground.
0	In 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem.
0	Francis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault.
0	Any other problems?
1	Commission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to “park” the priest out of harm’s way.
0	But this simple message was hard to get across.
0	It emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so.
0	Did commission members persevere?
0	Not all of them.
0	British member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016.
1	He said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise.
0	Irish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission’s request — approved by the pope — to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims.
0	Marie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile.
0	Catherine Bonnet / Associated Press
0	Was the pope listening to the commission?
0	Possibly not.
0	In 2015, Collins handed O’Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010.
0	Cruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile.
1	The pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as “lefties” and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month.
0	"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence," he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz.
1	That was too much for O’Malley, who said Francis had caused "great pain” to victims.
1	If Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to?
0	Vatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.
0	So is the pope intransigent on Barros?
0	No.
0	Something changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country.
0	On Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia.
0	"For the first time I felt that someone is listening," Cruz said after the meeting.
0	What happens next?
0	“This should lead to Barros stepping down,” said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse.
0	The new papal commission will meanwhile hold its first meeting in April.

0	Next plague outbreak in Madagascar could be 'stronger': WHO
1	Geneva - The World Health Organisation chief on Wednesday said a deadly plague epidemic appeared to have been brought under control in Madagascar, but warned the next outbreak would likely be stronger.
1	"The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, insisting that "the issue is serious."
0	An outbreak of both bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread person to person, has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since August.
0	Madagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires.
0	The disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April.
0	On average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.
1	But Tedros voiced alarm that "plague in Madagascar behaved in a very, very different way this year."
0	Cases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns.
0	The authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207.
1	He also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak.
1	He praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over.
0	The larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely.
1	This along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that "when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw," Tedros said.
1	"That means that Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond," he warned.
0	Complicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides.
0	"That's a dangerous combination," Tedros said.
0	Kavanaugh's Nomination Saved?
0	Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s outstanding performance at yesterday’s evidentiary hearing featuring attempted rape accuser Christine Blasey Ford may have revived his embattled nomination for the highest court in America.
0	The meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the underhanded tactics employed by the Left against Judge Kavanaugh.
1	The nominee and Republican senators used the opportunity to attack desperate Democrats for their efforts at character assassination.
0	President Trump was delighted.
0	“Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him[,]” President Trump tweeted at 6:46 p.m. after the hearing wrapped up.
0	“His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting.
1	Democrats’ search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist.
1	The Senate must vote!”
0	Ford, who claims Kavanaugh tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for several hours Thursday.
0	Kavanaugh testified separately after Ford’s testimony concluded.
1	Kavanaugh stole the show.
1	The judge forcefully stood up for himself as his voice trembled with righteous indignation, calling out Democratic senators for plotting against him.
0	The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment.
0	But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at Borking.
0	Those efforts didn't work.
0	When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked like I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed.
0	Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready.
0	This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee, and by staff.
0	It would be needed only if you couldn't take me out on the merits.
0	When it was needed, this allegation was unleashed and publicly deployed over Dr. Ford's wishes.
1	And then, and then as no doubt was expected, if not planned, came a long series of false last-minute smears designed to scare me and drive me out of the process before any hearing occurred.
1	Afraid of their own shadows, committee Republicans didn’t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to examine Ford.
0	Opinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.
0	She tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.
1	In much of her testimony, Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible, though vague and sometimes evasive, her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding.
0	Ford did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh’s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.
0	It’s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.
0	She could do little else.
0	She had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.
0	As commentator Sean Davis tweeted:
1	“Hard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.”
0	Nonetheless, Mitchell’s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.
1	She failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination.
0	In the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.
0	Whether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh’s side remains to be seen.
1	Like other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs.
1	After saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, “so I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?”
0	“No, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,” Ford replied.
0	When Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford “with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?” Ford replied, “one hundred percent.”
1	Strangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory.
0	She doesn’t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is “one hundred percent” certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.
0	At the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through –including the Democrats’ sordid behavior— since President Trump announced the judge’s nomination on July 9.
0	As part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.
1	“Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue – any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,” Grassley said.
0	Ford shared her allegations in a letter to the committee’s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.
0	The letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.
0	Instead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.
0	Before the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn’t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.
0	The committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.
0	Feinstein didn’t attend it, Grassley said.
0	Kavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.
0	That is “more than all prior Supreme Court nominees,” he said.
0	“Throughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.
0	Then, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.
0	And then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.”
0	“Every step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,” Grassley said.
0	After Ford’s identity became public, Grassley’s staff “contacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,” he said.
0	Kavanaugh “immediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.
0	He denied the allegations categorically.”
0	“Democratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.
1	Which leads me then to wonder: If they're really concerned with going to the truth, why wouldn't you want to talk to the accused?”
0	Grassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.
0	“All three submitted statements to the Senate under – under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.
0	Dr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. – Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.”
0	Grassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, “even volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent – present her allegations to Congress.”
0	“Consistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination” by any means possible, “pushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.”
0	“We've been trying to investigate other allegations,” Grassley said.
0	“At this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.”
0	Attorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.
0	“Neither attorney has made their clients available for interview.
1	The committee can't do an investigation if attorneys are stonewalling.”
1	With his performance at the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues, partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives.
1	While questioning Kavanaugh, Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through, calling it “the most unethical sham since I've been in politics.”
0	Lashing out at Democrats, Graham said, “If you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.
1	What you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020.”
1	“Boy, you all want power,” he shouted.
0	“God, I hope you never get it.
1	I hope the American people can see through this sham.”
0	Graham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.
1	“To my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.
0	You want this seat?
1	I hope you never get it.”
1	Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) attacked Democrats, blaming them for the “circus atmosphere that has been created” since they first Ford's allegations to the media “two weeks ago, after sitting on them for six weeks.” This “has brought us the worst in our politics.”
0	“It certainly has brought us no closer to the truth,” Hatch added.
1	“Anonymous letters with no name and no return address are now being treated as national news.” Taking a shot at Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, Hatch said “porn star lawyers with facially implausible claims are driving the news cycle.”
0	“I hate to say this, but this is worse than Robert Bork, and I didn't think it could get any worse than that.
0	This is worse than Clarence Thomas.
1	I didn't think it could get any worse than that.
1	This is a national disgrace, the way you're being treated.”
0	The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination today at 9:30 a.m.
0	Asked last night about the nomination moving to the floor of the Senate for a final vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) reportedly answered, "Depends on what happens tomorrow."
0	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is planning a procedural vote on Saturday to formally move to the nomination, followed by a potential confirmation vote by the full Senate as soon as Tuesday, Politico reports.
1	A handful of Democrat senators, including the perpetually vulnerable red-state senator, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are reportedly considering voting to confirm Kavanaugh when the nomination goes before the full Senate.
0	If Kavanaugh isn’t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.
0	It normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy’s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh’s nomination, there have been only eight justices.
0	Roughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.
0	Democrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to seize control from Republicans.
0	Election Day is November 6.
0	The GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.
0	The confirmation drama continues.

0	Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence JANUARY 17, 2018 / 9:06 AM / A DAY AGO Reuters Staff STOCKHOLM (Reuters) – Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.
0	Sweden’s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope.
0	… Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
0	One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
0	Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants.
1	… “People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday.
1	“This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly … have fought to create for so many years,” he said sarcastically.
0	From Reuters:Wikipedia has a page devoted to “ List of Grenade Attacks in Sweden ,” which lists 80 different attacks beginning in 2014.
1	That’s crazy.
1	Guardian ups its vilification of Julian Assange
1	It is welcome that finally there has been a little pushback, including from leading journalists, to the Guardian’s long-running vilification of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks.
1	Reporter Luke Harding’s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump’s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador’s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it.
0	Faced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly – and very quietly – rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts.
0	Instead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, “sources”.
1	The propaganda function of the piece is patent.
0	It is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump’s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.
0	The Guardian’s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party’s servers.
0	In truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved.
0	Central actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party.
1	Nonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails.
0	These show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost.
1	To underscore the intended effect of the Guardian’s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to “Russians” joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange.
0	Manafort has denied the Guardian’s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel.
0	‘Responsible for Trump’
0	The emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule.
1	But more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher – and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times – but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power.
0	The intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals.
0	That, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency.
0	The Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador’s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.
0	It will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.
0	And it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.
1	For the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange’s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian.
1	Even when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily – and unlawfully – detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report.
0	See here and here.
0	Now Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again.
0	An administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.
0	Heavy surveillance
1	The problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed “sources”.
0	Glenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere.
0	The environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange’s fate.
1	The idea that Manafort or “Russians” could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous.
0	According to Greenwald: “If Paul Manafort … visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened.
0	The Guardian provides none of that.”
0	Former British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit.
0	Any visits by Manafort would have been logged.
1	In fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy’s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or “Russians” being identified in them.
0	It did not refer to the logs in its latest story.
0	Murray:
1	The problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador’s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.
1	Neither Manafort nor these “Russians” are in the visitor logs … What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?
1	Furthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency – who were in charge of the security – would not know the identity of these alleged “Russians”.
0	No fact-checking
0	It is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true – both because Assange’s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake.
1	Given this, one would have expected the Guardian’s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding’s story.
0	At a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication.
0	Neither precaution was taken.
0	I worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication.
0	In that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.
1	And yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset.
0	That at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had “insurance” on this story.
0	And the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services – presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador.
1	It appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value.
0	Even if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them.
1	That is profoundly irresponsible journalism – fake news – that should be of the gravest concern to readers.
0	A pattern, not an aberration
1	Despite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian’s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern.
1	Glenn Greenwald, who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent, though unacknowledged, falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations, wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian’s latest story.
1	First, he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian’s long-standing (and well-documented) hostility towards Assange.
1	“The Guardian, an otherwise solid and reliable paper, has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.”
1	It was also apparently evidence of the paper’s clickbait tendencies:
1	“They [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they’d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false.”
1	And finally, in a bizarre tweet, Greenwald opined, “I hope the story [maligning Assange] turns out true” – apparently because maintenance of the Guardian’s reputation is more important than Assange’s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned.
0	I think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists.
0	I hope the story turns out true.
1	But the skepticism over this story is very widespread, including among Assange's most devoted haters, because it's so sketchy.
0	If Manafort went there, there's video.
0	Let's see it.
0	— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018
0	Deeper malaise
0	What this misses is that the Guardian’s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity.
0	They are entirely predictable and systematic.
1	Rather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper’s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media.
0	Even aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from “solid and reliable”, as Greenwald claims.
1	It has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel’s right to continue its belligerent occupation.
0	Over the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby’s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite.
0	See here, here and here.
1	Similarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process – another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency.
1	The Guardian’s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts.
1	Its especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region’s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington.
1	The Guardian has been vocal in the so-called “fake news” hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative.
1	The Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right.
0	Heroes of the neoliberal order
1	Equally, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are.
1	Certainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse.
1	Its pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory – the attack on Iraq.
1	That “humanitarian intervention” cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right.
1	None of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world’s future.
1	The Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled “weapons expert”.
0	Like Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying “independently”.
1	Higgins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria.
1	That clear partisanship should be no surprise, given that Higgins now enjoys an “academic” position at, and funding from, the Atlantic Council, a high-level, Washington-based think-tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda.
1	Improbably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as “fake news” whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations.
1	The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.
0	With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.
1	Its job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle-blowing against a corrupt western elite; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel-Palestine; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of “America’s backyard”; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite-friendly narratives of corporate media, including the Guardian.
1	The Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.
0	It did what it is designed to do.
1	UPDATE: Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter, published shortly before Harding’s story, explains why the Guardian’s hit-piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars.

0	Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama
0	A former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.
0	Specifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.
0	His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.
0	“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.
0	Hillary is still walking free.
0	Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.
0	We want them to correct the wrong.”
0	Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.
0	There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.
0	“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.
0	“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”
0	While campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.
0	Trump often compared the Obama administration’s handling of Saucier’s case with that of Clinton.
0	Saucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.
0	He said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.
0	Saucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.
0	But he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails.
0	“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” he said.
1	“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.”
0	Saucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.
0	A felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.
0	Now, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.
0	“Things are starting to go in the right direction,” Saucier said.
0	“I work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.”
0	Because of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.

0	Julian Assange
0	The persecution of Julian Assange must end.
0	Or it will end in tragedy.
0	The Australian government and prime minister Malcolm Turnbull have an historic opportunity to decide which it will be.
0	They can remain silent, for which history will be unforgiving.
1	Or they can act in the interests of justice and humanity and bring this remarkable Australian citizen home.
0	Assange does not ask for special treatment.
1	The government has clear diplomatic and moral obligations to protect Australian citizens abroad from gross injustice: in Julian’s case, from a gross miscarriage of justice and the extreme danger that await him should he walk out of the Ecuadorean embassy in London unprotected.
0	We know from the Chelsea Manning case what he can expect if a U.S. extradition warrant is successful — a United Nations Special Rapporteur called it torture.
1	I know Julian Assange well; I regard him as a close friend, a person of extraordinary resilience and courage.
1	I have watched a tsunami of lies and smear engulf him, endlessly, vindictively, perfidiously; and I know why they smear him.
0	In 2008, a plan to destroy both WikiLeaks and Assange was laid out in a top secret document dated 8 March, 2008.
0	The authors were the Cyber Counter-intelligence Assessments Branch of the U.S. Defence Department.
0	They described in detail how important it was to destroy the “feeling of trust” that is WikiLeaks’ “centre of gravity”.

1	This would be achieved, they wrote, with threats of “exposure [and] criminal prosecution” and a unrelenting assault on reputation.
0	The aim was to silence and criminalise WikiLeaks and its editor and publisher.
1	It was as if they planned a war on a single human being and on the very principle of freedom of speech.
0	Vichy Media
1	Their main weapon would be personal smear.
1	Their shock troops would be enlisted in the media — those who are meant to keep the record straight and tell us the truth.
0	The irony is that no one told these journalists what to do.
1	I call them Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served and enabled the German occupation of wartime France.
1	Last October, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist Sarah Ferguson interviewed Hillary Clinton, over whom she fawned as “the icon for your generation”.
1	This was the same Clinton who threatened to “obliterate totally” Iran and, who, as U.S. secretary of State in 2011, was one of the instigators of the invasion and destruction of Libya as a modern state, with the loss of 40,000 lives.
1	Like the invasion of Iraq, it was based on lies.
1	When the Libyan President was murdered publicly and gruesomely with a knife, Clinton was filmed whooping and cheering.
1	Thanks largely to her, Libya became a breeding ground for ISIS and other jihadists.
0	Thanks largely to her, tens of thousands of refugees fled in peril across the Mediterranean, and many drowned.
0	WikiLeaks Exposed Clinton
0	Leaked emails published by WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton’s foundation – which she shares with her husband – received millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the main backers of ISIS and terrorism across the Middle East.
1	As Secretary of State, Clinton approved the biggest arms sale ever — worth $80 billion — to Saudi Arabia, one of her foundation’s principal benefactors.
1	Today, Saudi Arabia is using these weapons to crush starving and stricken people in a genocidal assault on Yemen.
1	Sarah Ferguson, a highly paid reporter, raised not a word of this with Hillary Clinton sitting in front of her.
0	Instead, she invited Clinton to describe the “damage” Julian Assange did “personally to you”.
1	In response, Clinton defamed Assange, an Australian citizen, as “very clearly a tool of Russian intelligence” and “a nihilistic opportunist who does the bidding of a dictator”.
1	She offered no evidence — nor was asked for any — to back her grave allegations.
1	At no time was Assange offered the right of reply to this shocking interview, which Australia’s publicly-funded state broadcaster had a duty to give him.
1	As if that wasn’t enough, Ferguson’s executive producer, Sally Neighour, followed the interview with a vicious re-tweet: “Assange is Putin’s bitch.
1	We all know it!”
1	There are many other examples of Vichy journalism.
1	The Guardian, reputedly once a great liberal newspaper, conducted a vendetta against Julian Assange.
1	Like a spurned lover, the Guardian aimed its personal, petty, inhuman and craven attacks at a man whose work it once published and profited from.

1	The former editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, called the WikiLeaks disclosures, which his newspaper published in 2010, “one of the greatest journalistic scoops of the last 30 years”.
0	Awards were lavished and celebrated as if Julian Assange did not exist.
0	Maligning and Profiting off Assange
0	WikiLeaks’ revelations became part of the Guardian’s marketing plan to raise the paper’s cover price.
1	They made money, often big money, while WikiLeaks and Assange struggled to survive.
1	With not a penny going to WikiLeaks, a hyped Guardian book led to a lucrative Hollywood movie deal.
1	The book’s authors, Luke Harding and David Leigh, gratuitously abused Assange as a “damaged personality” and “callous”.
0	They also revealed the secret password Julian had given the Guardian in confidence and which was designed to protect a digital file containing the U.S. embassy cables.
1	With Assange now trapped in the Ecuadorean embassy, Harding, who had enriched himself on the backs of both Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, stood among the police outside the embassy and gloated on his blog that “Scotland Yard may get the last laugh”.
0	The question is why.
0	Julian Assange has committed no crime.
0	He has never been charged with a crime.
1	The Swedish episode was bogus and farcical and he has been vindicated.
1	Katrin Axelsson and Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape summed it up when they wrote, “The allegations against [Assange] are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape, murder and destruction… The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will.”
1	This truth was lost or buried in a media witch-hunt that disgracefully associated Assange with rape and misogyny.
1	The witch-hunt included voices who described themselves as on the left and as feminist.
1	They willfully ignored the evidence of extreme danger should Assange be extradited to the United States.
1	According to a document released by Edward Snowden, Assange is on a “Manhunt target list”.
1	One leaked official memo says: “Assange is going to make a nice bride in prison.
1	Screw the terrorist.
0	He’ll be eating cat food forever.”
1	In Alexandra, Virginia – the suburban home of America’s war-making elite — a secret grand jury, a throwback to the middle ages — has spent seven years trying to concoct a crime for which Assange can be prosecuted.
0	This is not easy; the U.S. Constitution protects publishers, journalists and whistleblowers.
0	Assange’s crime is to have broken a silence.
0	They Never Happened
1	No investigative journalism in my lifetime can equal the importance of what WikiLeaks has done in calling rapacious power to account.
1	It is as if a one-way moral screen has been pushed back to expose the imperialism of liberal democracies: the commitment to endless warfare and the division and degradation of “unworthy” lives: from Grenfell Tower to Gaza.
1	When Harold Pinter accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, he referred to “a vast tapestry of lies up on which we feed”.
1	He asked why “the systematic brutality, the widespread atrocities, the ruthless suppression of independent thought” of the Soviet Union were well known in the West while America’s imperial crimes “never happened … even while [they] were happening, they never happened.” No Place to Hide: Edwa...

1	In its revelations of fraudulent wars (Afghanistan, Iraq) and the bald-faced lies of governments (the Chagos Islands), WikiLeaks has allowed us to glimpse how the imperial game is played in the 21st century.
1	That is why Assange is in mortal danger.
0	Seven years ago, in Sydney, I arranged to meet a prominent Liberal Member of the Federal Parliament, Malcolm Turnbull.
0	I wanted to ask him to deliver a letter from Gareth Peirce, Assange’s lawyer, to the government.
0	We talked about his famous victory — in the 1980s when, as a young barrister, he had fought the British Government’s attempts to suppress free speech and prevent the publication of the book Spycatcher — in its way, a WikiLeaks of the time, for it revealed the crimes of state power.
1	The prime minister of Australia was then Julia Gillard, a Labor Party politician who had declared WikiLeaks “illegal” and wanted to cancel Assange’s passport — until she was told she could not do this: that Assange had committed no crime: that WikiLeaks was a publisher, whose work was protected under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia was one of the original signatories.
1	In abandoning Assange, an Australian citizen, and colluding in his persecution, Prime Minister Gillard’s outrageous behaviour forced the issue of his recognition, under international law, as a political refugee whose life was at risk.
0	Ecuador invoked the 1951 Convention and granted Assange refuge in its embassy in London.
1	Gillard has recently been appearing in a gig with Hillary Clinton; they are billed as pioneering feminists.
1	If there is anything to remember Gillard by, it a warmongering, sycophantic, embarrassing speech she made to the US Congress soon after she demanded the illegal cancellation of Julian’s passport.
0	Malcolm Turnbull is now the Prime Minister of Australia.
0	Julian Assange’s father has written to Turnbull.
0	It is a moving letter, in which he has appealed to the prime minister to bring his son home.
0	He refers to the real possibility of a tragedy.
0	I have watched Assange’s health deteriorate in his years of confinement without sunlight.
0	He has had a relentless cough, but is not even allowed safe passage to and from a hospital for an X-ray.
0	Malcolm Turnbull can remain silent.
1	Or he can seize this opportunity and use his government’s diplomatic influence to defend the life of an Australian citizen, whose courageous public service is recognised by countless people across the world.
0	He can bring Julian Assange home.

1	Illegal Alien Wife Beaters Protected by Sanctuary City Mayor Busted
1	Sanctuary cities are the real war on women.
0	And Democrats are the ones fighting it.
0	Democrats like Oakland's Mayor Schaaf.
0	Three illegal immigrants, who avoided capture after Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf blew the whistle on a raid by federal immigration authorities last month, have since been re-arrested for new crimes including robbery and spousal abuse, ICE officials said.
0	Schaaf tweeted out a warning ahead of the raid in northern California last month, infuriating Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and the Trump administration.
1	“How dare you!” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in California this month, addressing Schaaf.
1	“How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical, open borders agenda.”
1	ICE officials eventually caught 232 illegal immigrants, many of them criminals, in the four-day sweep but said that hundreds more escaped because of Schaaf’s warning.
0	But on Tuesday, officials said that at least three of those who were targeted in the raid, but were not apprehended, had since been arrested for additional crimes.
0	One was a Mexican national arrested for robbery and gun crimes, who was released back into the community for a prior offense despite an ICE detainer request in November.
0	Another Mexican national was arrested for a DUI, despite having been deported three times and prior convictions for false imprisonment, DUI and battery of a spouse.
0	The third was a Mexican national who was arrested for corporal injury of a spouse, despite being deported twice and criminal convictions including drug possession, hit-and-run, DUIs, possessions of narcotics equipment and a parole violation.
0	Julian Assange
0	During World War II Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty was a huge critic of fascism and wound up in prison.
0	In Oct. 1945 he became head of the Church in Hungary and spoke out just as strongly against Communist oppression.
0	He wound up back in prison for eight more years, including long periods of solitary confinement and endured other forms of torture.
1	In 1949 he was sentenced to life in a show trial that generated worldwide condemnation.
0	Two weeks after the trial began in early 1949, Pope Pius XII (having failed to speak out forcefully against the Third Reich) did summon the courage to condemn what was happening to Mindszenty.
0	Pius excommunicated everyone involved in the Mindszenty trial.
1	Then, addressing a huge crowd on St. Peter’s Square, he asked, “Do you want a Church that remains silent when she should speak … a Church that does not condemn the suppression of conscience and does not stand up for the just liberty of the people … a Church that locks herself up within the four walls of her temple in unseemly sycophancy …?”
0	When the Hungarian revolution broke out in 1956, Mindszenty was freed, but only for four days.

0	Mindszenty’s mother was permitted to visit him four times a year, and the communist authorities stationed secret police outside the embassy ready to arrest him should he try to leave.
0	Sound familiar?
1	Where is the voice of conscience to condemn what is happening to Julian Assange, whose only “crime” is publishing documents exposing the criminal activities and corruption of governments and other Establishment elites?
0	Decades ago, the U.S. and “civilized world” had nothing but high praise for the courageous Mindszenty.
0	He became a candidate for sainthood.
0	And Assange?
1	He has been confined in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for six years —from June 19, 2012—the victim of a scurrilous slander campaign and British threats to arrest him, should he ever step outside.
1	The U.S. government has been putting extraordinary pressure on Ecuador to end his asylum and top U.S. officials have made it clear that, as soon as they get their hands on him, they will manufacture a reason to put him on trial and put him in prison.
1	All for spreading unwelcome truth around.
0	A Suppression of Conscience
1	One might ask, is “unseemly sycophancy” at work among the media?
1	The silence of what used to be the noble profession of journalism is deafening.
1	John Pilger — one of the few journalists to speak out on Julian Assange’s behalf, labels journalists who fail to stand in solidarity with Assange in exposing the behavior of the Establishment, “Vichy journalists — after the Vichy government that served ad enabled the German occupation of France.”

1	Fourth Estate on Life Support
0	In 2010, while he was still a free man, the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity gave its annual award to Assange.
0	The citation read:
1	“It seems altogether fitting and proper that this year’s award be presented in London, where Edmund Burke coined the expression “Fourth Estate.” Comparing the function of the press to that of the three Houses then in Parliament, Burke said: “…but in the Reporters Gallery yonder, there sits a Fourth Estate more important far then they all.” The year was 1787—the year the U.S. Constitution was adopted.
0	The First Amendment, approved four years later, aimed at ensuring that the press would be free of government interference.
0	That was then.
1	With the Fourth Estate now on life support, there is a high premium on the fledgling Fifth Estate, which uses the ether and is not susceptible of government or corporation control.
1	Small wonder that governments with lots to hide feel very threatened.
0	It has been said: “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” WikiLeaks is helping make that possible by publishing documents that do not lie.
0	Last spring, when we chose WikiLeaks and Julian Assange for this award, Julian said he would accept only “on behalf or our sources, without which WikiLeaks’ contributions are of no significance.” We do not know if Pvt.
1	Bradley Manning gave WikiLeaks the gun-barrel video of July 12, 2007 called “Collateral Murder.” Whoever did provide that graphic footage, showing the brutality of the celebrated “surge” in Iraq, was certainly far more a patriot than the “mainstream” journalist embedded in that same Army unit.
1	He suppressed what happened in Baghdad that day, dismissed it as simply “one bad day in a surge that was filled with such days,” and then had the temerity to lavish praise on the unit in a book he called “The Good Soldiers.” Julian is right to emphasize that the world is deeply indebted to patriotic truth-tellers like the sources who provided the gun-barrel footage and the many documents on Afghanistan and Iraq to WikiLeaks.
0	We hope to have a chance to honor them in person in the future.
0	Today we honor WikiLeaks, and one of its leaders, Julian Assange, for their ingenuity in creating a new highway by which important documentary evidence can make its way, quickly and confidentially, through the ether and into our in-boxes.
1	Long live the Fifth Estate!”
0	Eventually a compromise was found in 1971 when Pope Paul VI lifted the excommunications and Mindszenty was able to leave the U.S. embassy.
0	Can such a diplomatic solution be found to free Assange?

1	Hungarian Prime Minister: ‘Christianity is Europe’s last hope’
0	NewsFaith, Politics - World
1	BUDAPEST, Hungary, February 19, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Brushing aside any semblance of political correctness, Hungary’s Prime Minister said in his state of the nation speech on Sunday that, “Christianity is Europe's last hope.”
1	Addressing his country and the world, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned that European nations which have encouraged migration have, “opened the way to the decline of Christian culture and the advance of Islam.”
0	Orbán painted an image of Western Europe being overwhelmed by the accelerating influx Muslim immigrants in recent years.
0	“According to estimates, the proportion of immigrants will grow at an accelerated pace in the European countries west of us,” said Orbán.
0	“I won't even say anything about France and Holland, but even the born Germans are being forced back from most large German cities as migrants always occupy big cities first.”
1	Orbán warned that as Western Europe becomes saturated with Muslim occupants, Islamists would soon seek to stream in to his country from both Western Europe as well as from Islamic nations.
1	“This means that the Islamic civilization, which always considers its vocation to convert Europe to what it calls the true faith, in the future will be knocking on the door of Central Europe not only from the south, but from the west, as well,” he said.
0	Prime Minister Orbán said his government will oppose efforts by the United Nations or the European Union to “increase migration” around the world.
0	In June, LifeSiteNews reported that Orbán had taken a strong stand and not backed down against outside globalist influences seeking to control his nation’s politics.
1	Billionaire George Soros, who famously backs many progressive initiatives around the world, locked horns with Orbán over the Central European University (CEU) he founded in 1989, which has been criticized as a funnel for anti-nationalist views.
0	Orbán and Soros have a history, beginning in partnership and ending in acrimony.
0	Orbán started public life as a crusader against communism and attended Oxford University on a Soros scholarship.
0	Soros, who expatriated from Hungary, also funded Orbán’s political organization, the Alliance for Young Democrats.
1	But Orbán’s defense of conservative values has led to breaking ties with Soros, whom he now criticizes as a foreigner meddling in his country’s affairs.
1	After Prime Minister Orbán delivered his strongly worded state of the nation speech, a UK Daily Mail report said, “Orbán has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.”
0	The Daily Mail report continued:
1	Soros, for his part, compared Orbán unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's, when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany.
0	But Orbán remains committed to his policy, claiming that Soros and supporters of migration are losing the fight.
0	He said: “Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too.
0	Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted.
0	It won't work.
0	We are not alone and we will fight together and we will succeed.”
0	In addition to inviting Soros’ ire, Orbán came under fire a couple years ago from the U.S. State Department under President Obama as well as the European Parliament for purportedly discriminating against homosexuals because of Hungary’s insistence on defining marriage between a man and a woman, and that pre-born babies have rights.
0	Last year, Orbán also criticized liberals and encouraged citizens to give life to more children during the 11th conference of the World Congress of Families.
0	Three thousand “natural family” advocates who attended the four-day conference heard Orbán in his opening address lambaste the European Union (EU) for its “relativizing liberal ideology that’s an insult to families.”
0	Army Colonel: False Flag ‘Gulf of Tonkin Incident’ May Be Used to Get US Into War with Iran
1	Often, the American mainstream media becomes a de facto government employee, taking the claims of U.S. officials and reporting them as proven fact — and nothing exemplifies this penchant better than reporting on the Gulf of Tonkin incident — perhaps one of most flagrant lies ever dreamed up as a justification for war.
0	On August 5, 1964, the New York Times reported, “President Johnson has ordered retaliatory action against gunboats and ‘certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam’ after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.” Additional outlets, such as the Washington Post, echoed this claim.
0	But it wasn’t true.
1	At all.
0	In fact, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, as it became known, turned out to be a fictitious creation courtesy of the government to escalate war in Vietnam — leading to the deaths of tens of thousands of U.S. troops and millions of Vietnamese, fomenting the largest anti-war movement in American history, and tarnishing the reputation of a nation once considered at least somewhat noble in the eyes of the world.

0	In 2010, more than 1,100 transcripts from the Vietnam era were released, proving Congress and officials raised serious doubts about the information fed to them by the Pentagon and White House.
0	But while this internal grumbling took place, mainstream media dutifully reported official statements as if the veracity of the information couldn’t be disputed.
0	Tom Wells, author of the exhaustive exposé “The War Within: America’s Battle Over Vietnam,” explained the media egregiously erred in “almost exclusive reliance on U.S. government officials as sources of information” and “reluctance to question official pronouncements on ‘national security issues.’”
0	If due diligence had been performed, and reporters had raised appropriate doubts about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag, it’s arguable whether support for the contentious war would have lasted as long as it did.
0	Sadly, the United States has a tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.
0	And now, a US Army Colonel is predicting that another Gulf of Tonkin incident could bring us into war with Iran.
1	As President Donald Trump continues to surround himself with neocon warhawks, the drums are beating for war with Iran.
0	The rhetoric is becoming so strong, that Trump himself — without provocation — began tweeting threats to the sovereign nation.
0	On Tuesday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Colonel Douglas Macgregor addressed the growing prospect of US war with Iran and warned that a new “Gulf of Tonkin incident” could be used to drag us into it.
1	Carlson mocked the neocons’ claims that Iran is the “greatest threat” to America, explicitly noting that “virtually every attack in America has been inspired not by Iran, but by Iran’s Sunni enemies.”
1	Carlson pointed out how the neocons are hellbent on pushing the Trump administration into a new war.
1	“If there was ever a swamp in Washington you are looking at it — the foreign policy establishment — they are working overtime to ensnare the president in a mess in Iran,” Carlson said.
0	“Let’s hope that he understands exactly what’s going on.”
0	Pointing out Trump’s recent attempts at diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, Col. Macgregor weighed in, noting that he thinks Trump will attempt to avoid war with Iran.
0	However, he noted that a false flag could be used to drag us into it.
0	“I think the president needs to watch carefully for the potential for something like the Gulf of Tonkin incident,” Col. Macgregor said.
0	“Many of your viewers may not remember that it never happened and we could very well be treated to something like that in the Gulf.
0	We should watch for that, and this is an example of President Trump’s comments on fake news, he should not be sabotage by fake news.”
0	Carlson then pointed out how the Trump admin has reacted to fake news by attacking Syria—twice.
0	For those who may be unaware, the plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.
0	In fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009.
0	MEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.
0	They are hardly quiet about it.
0	According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
0	Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.
0	Ambassador John Bolton.
0	Coincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies—during this training period—until they suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.
1	While the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran is outright insane.
1	To see what US intervention—through military support and the support of ‘protesters’—does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America’s wake.
0	To those paying attention over the years, Trump’s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.
0	This was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.
0	“This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years,” Clark said.
0	“Starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.”
0	All presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.
0	Now it’s Trump’s turn.

0	9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.
0	By Jamie Glazov
1	While the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement “strategies” that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America’s favor.
1	Below are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:
0	1.
0	Label the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.
1	The Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war.
0	It is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e.
1	Islamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e.
0	Islamic law).
0	2.
1	Scrap “Countering Violent Extremism.”
1	“Countering Violent Extremism” is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war.
1	On the one hand, this “focus” is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.
1	On the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of “extremists” — who just happen to be the Left’s political opponents — that pose a great threat to the country.
1	For example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the “violent extremists” the administration is clearly worried about are the “right-wing Islamophobes” whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.
1	The “Countering Violent Extremism” is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.
0	3.
0	Stop “Partnering” With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.
0	The government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.
1	The Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood’s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups.
1	Moreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.
0	4.
1	Implement a Concrete “Countering-Jihad” Strategy.
1	After discarding the “Countering Violent Extremism” absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy.
1	It must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.
0	Most importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual “threat doctrine analysis” in a thorough document, just like George Kennan’s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.
1	It is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war — and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.
0	5.
0	Launch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.
0	The Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7.
0	What does our propaganda war entail?
1	Zilch.
1	Sebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts – which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.
0	Consequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.
1	These programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers.
0	This has to also involve, as Gorka urges, “a nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.”
1	The education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka’s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists’ hands.
0	6.
0	Affirm Sharia’s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.
1	Once the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e.
0	remember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).
0	Indeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.
0	7.
0	Put Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.
1	Authorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance — and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is “racist” and Islamophobic to do so.
1	Islamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it.
1	As Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists’ understanding of Islam — and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government.
0	(This will be a part of Gorka’s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).
1	Spencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the “trust” of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.
0	8.
1	Bring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.
0	Instead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.
1	Homeland Security Advisory Council (he “resigned” in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it.
1	We all know who these noble and courageous individuals are – and some of them are referenced in this article.
1	The government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.
0	(P.S.
1	Yes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad.
0	But the debate over this belongs in another forum.
0	And whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)
0	9.
0	Ridicule the Enemy.
1	Ridicule is a vicious and potent weapon.
1	There is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture’s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.
0	Bill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives’ eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.
1	American comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher’s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so – and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.
1	We must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world.
1	Indeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia’s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.

0	Trump suggests he would have picked another AG who could have blocked Russia probe
0	Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would have picked another attorney general if it would have stopped an investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 election.
0	In his latest public slam at Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- who, citing his involvement with the Trump campaign, recused himself from the investigation last year, paving the way for the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller -- Trump said he would have "quickly picked someone else" had he known about the recusal.
0	"The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself," Trump tweeted Tuesday.
0	"I would have quickly picked someone else.

0	New outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in northwest DR Congo
1	Seventeen people in northwest Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have died from Ebola, the health ministry said on Tuesday, describing the fresh outbreak as a "public health emergency with international impact."
0	"Twenty-one cases of fever with haemorrhagic indications and 17 deaths" have been recorded in Equateur province, it said, citing a notification to the ministry as of May 3.
0	It is the DRC's ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976, when the deady viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.
0	In Geneva, the World Health Organization (WHO) said lab tests in the DRC confirmed the presence of Ebola virus in two out of five samples collected from patients.
0	"WHO is working closely with the government of the DRC to rapidly scale up its operations and mobilize health partners, using the model of a successful response to a similar... outbreak in 2017," it said in a statement.
0	It said it had released $1 million (840,000 euros) from an emergency contingency fund, set up a coordination group and deployed more than 50 experts to work with the DRC government and health agencies.
0	"The action plan prepared by the health ministry has been approved," an official statement released after a cabinet meeting said.
0	- No new deaths -
0	"Since the notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported," it said, without specifying when the first case came to light.
0	The outbreak occurred in Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumba.
0	All the cases were reported from a clinic at Ilkoko Iponge, located about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Bikoro, where treatment capacities are limited, the WHO said.
0	A team of experts from the WHO, Doctors without Borders (DRC) and Equateur province travelled to Bikoro on Tuesday to beef up coordination and carry out investigations, it said.
1	Ebola is one of the world's most notorious diseases, being both highly infectious and extremely lethal.
0	It is caused by a virus that has a natural reservoir in the bat, which does not itself fall ill, but can pass the microbe on to humans who hunt it for "bushmeat".
0	The virus is handed on by contact with bodily fluids -- touching a sick or dead person is a well-known source of infection.
0	Following an incubation period of between two and 21 days, Ebola develops into a high fever, weakness, intense muscle and joint pain, headaches and a sore throat.
0	That is often followed by vomiting and diarrhoea, skin eruptions, kidney and liver failure, and internal and external bleeding.
0	The worst-ever Ebola outbreak started in December 2013 in southern Guinea before spreading to two neighbouring west African countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
0	That outbreak killed more than 11,300 people out of nearly 29,000 registered cases, according to WHO estimates, although the real figure is thought to be significantly higher.
0	More than 99 percent of victims were in the three West African countries, although cases occurred in other parts of the world, often stirring panic.
0	There is no current vaccine to prevent Ebola or licensed treatment for it, although a range of experimental drugs are in development.
0	Early care with rehydration may boost the chance of survival.
0	Given the lack of a pharmaceutical weapon against Ebola, health experts have responded with time-honoured measures of control, prevention and containment.
0	They use rigorous protocols to protect medical personnel with disposable full-body suits, masks, goggles and gloves and disinfecting sprays.

1	In Newly Obtained Memo, Congress’ Top Cop Said House Democratic Caucus Server VANISHED https://t.co/gTj2UgSZJr via @dailycaller — Luke Rosiak (@lukerosiak) July 2, 2018
0	A secret memo marked “URGENT” detailed how the House Democratic Caucus’s server went “missing” soon after it became evidence in a cybersecurity probe.
0	The secret memo also said more than “40 House offices may have been victims of IT security violations.”
0	In the memo, Congress’s top law enforcement official, Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, along with Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko, wrote, “We have concluded that the employees [Democratic systems administrator Imran Awan and his family] are an ongoing and serious risk to the House of Representatives, possibly threatening the integrity of our information systems and thereby members’ capacity to serve constituents.”
0	The memo, addressed to the Committee on House Administration (CHA) and dated Feb. 3, 2017, was recently reviewed and transcribed by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
0	The letter bolsters TheDCNF’s previous reporting about the missing server and evidence of fraud on Capitol Hill.
0	It details how the caucus server, run by then-caucus Chairman Rep. Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans’ physical access was not blocked.
0	But after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.
0	The memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.
0	Rep. Louie Gohmert — a Texas Republican on the House Committee on the Judiciary who has done oversight work on the case — said the missing server contained copies of Congress members’ emails.
0	“They put 40 members of Congress’s data on one server … That server, with that serial number, has disappeared,” he said.
0	Multiple sources connected to the investigation told TheDCNF that shortly after an IG report came out identifying the House Democratic Caucus server as key evidence in a criminal probe, the evidence was stolen.
0	“They [the Awans] deliberately turned over a fake server” to falsify evidence, one official close to the CHA alleged.
0	“It was a breach.
0	The data was completely out of [members’] possession.”
0	The six-page letter says:
0	• In September of 2016 … the CHA and [IG] briefed the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus about suspicious activity related to their server that the [IG] identified.
0	As a result, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus directed the CAO to copy the data from their server and two computers.
0	• The CHA directed the IG to refer the matter to the US Capitol Police.
0	The USCP initiated an investigation that continues to this day.
0	• In late 2016, the former Chairman of the Democratic Caucus announced his intention to resign from Congress to assume a new position.
0	The CAO and [sergeant-at-arms] worked with the Chairman to account for his inventory, including the one server.
0	• While reviewing the inventory, the CAO discovered that the serial number of the server did not match that of the one imaged in September.
0	[Investigators] also discovered that the server in question [the replacement server] was still operating under the employee’s control, contrary to the explicit instructions of the former chairman to turn over all equipment and fully cooperate with the inquiry and investigation.
0	[A House source said the "employee” was Abid Awan.]
0	• The USCP interviewed relevant staff regarding the missing server.
0	• On January 24, 2017, the CAO acquired the [r[replacement]erver from the control of the employees and transferred that server to the USCP.
0	President Donald Trump referenced the Democratic Caucus’ missing server in a tweet.
1	But because the letter to the CHA was kept secret, many news outlets have not grasped that the House’s top cop documented a “missing server” connected to the Democratic Caucus.
1	The timeline laid out in the letter also shows that Becerra — now California’s Democratic attorney general — failed to ensure that the Awans didn’t have access to House computer systems during the 2016 election, which was wrought with cybersecurity scandals.
0	An IG presentation from September 2016 shows that Becerra knew of problems months before the server disappeared.
0	“The Caucus Chief of Staff requested one of the shared employees to not provide IT services or access their computers,” it read.
1	“This shared employee continued.” It’s unclear why that request was not granted or why it was a request rather than an order.
0	A House official close to the probe said the employee was Abid, who was not on Becerra or the Caucus’s payroll.
0	The official said Becerra Chief of Staff Sean McCluskie apparently knew Abid was accessing Caucus servers.
0	According to payroll records, Abid’s sister-in-law, Hina Alvi, was the Caucus’ systems administrator.
0	The Awans’ continued physical access to Becerra’s equipment after red flags emerged enabled the server to disappear after it became evidence, House officials close to the investigation told TheDCNF.
0	(RELATED: Becerra Tried To Block Awan From House Democratic Caucus Server, But Logins Continued; He Didn’t Go To Cops)
0	Becerra has refused to comment, citing an ongoing criminal investigation.
1	The February 2017 memo itemizes “numerous and egregious violations of House IT security” by members of the Awan family, including using Congress members’ usernames and “the unauthorized storage of sensitive House information outside the House.”
0	“These employees accessed user accounts and computers for offices that did not employ them, without the knowledge and permission of the impacted Member’s office,” it said, adding, “4 of the employees accessed the Democratic Caucus computers 5,735 times.” More than 100 office computers were open to access from people not on the office’s staff, it said.
0	Chris Gowen — a former aide to Hillary Clinton who is now serving as Imran’s attorney — told TheDCNF, “There is no missing server and never was.”
1	He didn’t provide any support for his claim, which is contrary to evidence Kiko and Irving presented to Congress.
0	The memo said the CHA possesses voluminous evidence, including, “Interview notes with House Members’ Chiefs of Staff,” and “Logon activity and computer access logs.” Prosecutors have not brought charges.
0	The Awans were banned from Congress’s computer network the day the letter was sent, and Kiko held a briefing to convey the message to chiefs of staff for members who employed them.
0	But Democrats claim they were never told about any of the cybersecurity issues itemized in the urgent memo.
0	Rep. Jackie Speier — a California Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who employed Imran and his wife, Hina Alvi — said she never heard of any missing server.
0	Joaquin Castro of Texas — another Democratic intelligence committee member who employed one of the Awans — told TheDCNF that Kiko never told him of any cybersecurity issues whatsoever and that the Awan probe was instead described as a theft issue.
1	Indeed, the CHA issued only one public statement on the case and titled it the “House Theft Investigation” — wording that avoids cybersecurity words while political news coverage raged about other cybersecurity issues in the 2016 election.
0	Yet even the alleged theft has not resulted in criminal charges — even though the letter also says House authorities have “purchase orders and vouchers” that allegedly show procurement fraud, as well as testimony from a Democratic chief of staff to Rep. Yvette Clarke, who warned of procurement fraud.
0	The FBI arrested Imran at the airport in July 2017 for alleged bank fraud that occurred six months prior, and Democrats have since claimed that the case is about nothing but bank fraud.
0	Bank fraud does not explain why the Awans were kicked off the House network concurrent with the urgent memo, which did not cite bank fraud.
1	A Democratic IT aide who alleged that Imran solicited a bribe from him told TheDCNF he believes members of Congress are playing dumb and covering the matter up.
0	Wendy Anderson, a former chief of staff to New York Rep. Yvette Clarke, told House investigators that she suspected that her predecessor, Shelley Davis, was working with Abid on a theft scheme, but Clarke refused to fire Abid until outside investigators got involved, TheDCNF reported.
0	Eighteen months after the evidence was recounted in the urgent memo, prosecution appears to have stalled for reasons not publicly explained.
0	Imran is in court July 3 for a possible plea deal in the bank fraud case.
0	Gohmert said the FBI has refused to accept evidence demonstrating alleged House misconduct, and some witnesses with first-hand knowledge say the bureau has not interviewed them.
