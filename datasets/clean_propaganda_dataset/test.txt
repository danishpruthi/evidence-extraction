0	Archbishop Hebda and McCarrick's Scandal
0	Archbishop Bernard Hebda of St. Paul, MN, responds to the McCarrick scandal (The Catholic Spirit):
1	Every time Mass is celebrated, the priest prays that Jesus will “look not on our sins but on the faith of [his] Church… .” That’s been an important prayer for me in the time that I have been serving this archdiocese, well aware of our sins but equally aware of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.
1	I’ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.
1	To make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless “promoted” to become the archbishop in our nation’s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.
1	While I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there’s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don’t, I don’t think that the Church in the United States will rest — and confidence will be restored — until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn’t happen again.
0	The matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.
0	It was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.
1	A number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.
0	I can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.
0	What I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.
0	When serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).
1	By the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.
0	It would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.
1	Years before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read — as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer — an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.
0	While the complaint didn’t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that “Archbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.” The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.
0	Knowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.
0	I can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.
1	I heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick.
1	With St. John Paul II’s 1995 visit, he was remembered for “bringing a saint to Newark,” not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.
0	When I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.
0	I can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.
1	While the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there’s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese.
1	The events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege.
0	I was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.
1	Our heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that “where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.” May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.
1	REMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called "gay lifestyle," which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime.
1	Far from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an "inclusive community" that "welcomes all" and "judges none."
1	All very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.
0	In fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:
0	Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."
0	They are contrary to the natural law.
0	They close the sexual act to the gift of life.
0	They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.
0	Under no circumstances can they be approved.
0	(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)
1	Under no circumstances…except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.
1	Even Pope John Paul "The GREAT's" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the “Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons”:
0	Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.
0	Therefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.
0	It is not.
1	Notice the late pope does not say, “Let the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,” as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.
1	Does Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?
1	Does he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?
0	Does His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our "Catholic Christian" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?
0	Pope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.
1	In his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an “ideology of evil,” insisting of so-called 'gay marriage' that:
1	“It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.”
1	Was Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?
1	Are Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?
1	Or is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration?
1	And if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception.
1	We're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.
1	So why are our bishops playing dumb?
1	Quite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.
1	This is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!
1	But, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of "accompaniment" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.
0	So what's going on here?
1	Who are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?
1	Is it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the "gay lifestyle" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?
1	The Catholic Church's new-found "climate of tolerance" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!
1	It is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground.
1	This is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.
1	Again, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it’s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that’s going on here.
1	Our bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.
1	And neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our “most enlightened” age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.
1	Until the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.
1	McCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.
0	No sign of breakthrough after Pompeo meets with Saudi rulers over missing journalist
1	WASHINGTON — On an emergency mission to resolve a diplomatic crisis, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo held delicate talks Tuesday with the rulers of Saudi Arabia amid growing suspicions that a Virginia-based Saudi columnist was killed on their orders.
0	Pompeo did not report any progress following a day of meetings in Riyadh with Saudi King Salman and his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto ruler.
1	President Donald Trump on Monday ordered Pompeo to rush to the desert kingdom to try to determine the fate of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, and the diplomat quickly hopped a plane.
0	In his meetings, Pompeo conveyed “U.S.
0	concern” about Khashoggi’s disappearance two weeks ago, the State Department said, and stressed “the importance of a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation.”
0	The talks were “direct and candid,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
0	Pompeo reminded his hosts that despite the numerous bilateral issues the two governments share, determining Khashoggi’s fate was the urgent purpose of this trip, she said.
0	Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the autocratic Saudi leadership, was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on Oct. 2, where he was seeking papers to marry his fiancée.
1	Turkish media reports, based in part on apparent audio recordings, have said Khashoggi was beaten to death and then dismembered in the building.
0	A 15-member Saudi military team had entered the consulate with a bone saw shortly before Khashoggi arrived, and flew out of the country soon after, the reports said.
0	Saudi officials insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate but have provided no video or other evidence.
0	They have denied any responsibility for his disappearance.
0	Hoping to stem a growing furor, Trump on Monday suggested “rogue killers,” not the Saudi royal family, may have carried out the murder.
0	Critics quickly said that Trump was providing an excuse for the Saudi leaders, and participating in a cover-up.
1	That seemed to set the stage for Saudi officials to find a way to explain away the alleged shocking death.
0	They floated the idea later Monday of claiming that Khashoggi, who wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post and Arab media, was accidentally killed in an interrogation gone awry inside the consulate — supposedly without the approval of the king or crown prince.
0	Publicly, Pompeo and his hosts looked calm and friendly when they met Tuesday in Riyadh.
0	At one point, as they greeted each other, Prince Mohammed noted the two countries were important allies.
0	“Absolutely,” Pompeo said, smiling.
0	The United States long guaranteed Saudi security in exchange for a steady supply of oil.
0	Those ties have frayed even as the Trump administration has embraced the Saudi rulers as a crucial regional ally in efforts to constrain Iran and to craft a peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians.
0	The current crisis has put those broader goals at risk, and the White House has scrambled to find a face-saving solution for the Saudi rulers.
1	Trump has said he would impose “severe” punishment if proof emerges that Saudi rulers sanctioned Khashoggi’s murder, but he has not said what that would entail.
0	He has ruled out cancelling or suspending billions of dollars in arms deals with the oil-rich country.
0	Many members of Congress have demanded the White House take tougher actions, including punitive sanctions on Saudi rulers.
0	But Congress has taken no action on its own.

0	FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLINE: Archbishop Lefebvre’s Prophetic Address to The Remnant, 1976
1	On that occasion Archbishop Lefebvre delivered an address on the desperate state of the Church at that time—42 years ago—that was never transcribed or published until we did so for the December 15, 2017 print edition of The Remnant.
0	It was held at the Radisson South Hotel, Minneapolis, on Tuesday, May 12, 1976, and its stated purpose was to assist the Archbishop in gaining a stronger foothold for the Society of St. Pius X in the States during the unprecedented crisis Blessed Pope Paul had helped unleash on the Church.
1	I’m posting the address here because I'm convinced the Archbishop’s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis.
0	And for those of us who’ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.
0	Even though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.
0	In fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial moment in the history of this movement—Stay in the fight!
0	Keep the Faith.
0	Never surrender!
1	This address also makes it absolutely clear that everything Archbishop Lefebvre did was part of an eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy.
0	And now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century’s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.
0	May we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.
0	MJM
0	The Archbishop Speaks
0	Ladies and Gentlemen:
0	As I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I can say in bad English what he says in good English, because he said all of the things I want to say [Referring here to Walter Matt’s introductory talk referenced above.]
0	And I thank you, Mr. Matt, very much, for his invitation, and I thank you for your coming, and I thank Fr.
0	Ward for what he said about the Society of St. Pius X.
0	And I hope that you can understand my poor English, but I think it is better to speak some bad English because to translate would take too much time.
0	As Mr. Matt said, the crisis in the Church is very extraordinary.
0	It is very difficult to understand the situation today.
0	My seminary in Econe (in Switzerland) and the seminaries in Germany and here in America, in Armada, are in very difficult situations with Rome.
0	Why?
0	These seminaries are the same as seminaries were before the Second Vatican Council.
0	They have the same discipline and the same studies, they make good priests; I think they are good seminarians.
0	All is done as all the seminaries before the Second Vatican Council.
0	Why are we now in this very sad situation with Rome?
1	I think that because in the Second Vatican Council, and after the Council, there is a mutation, a change, in the Church.
0	But we do not change.
0	We continue the Tradition.
0	So why do they now say, as Mgr.
0	(Archbishop) Benelli[1] said to me months ago on the 19th of March, “you are out of communion with the Church.” I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?
0	This is possible?
0	I do not understand.
0	Why?
0	I have done nothing.
0	I believe nothing other than what the Church has believed for twenty centuries.
0	Mgr.
0	Benelli then said to me, you must put down in a writing to the Holy Father that you accept the Second Vatican Council, you accept the reform that followed the Council, and that you accept the orientations that have been given by Rome.
0	Mgr.
0	Benelli took the book of the New Ordo, gave it to me, and said, “You must say this New Mass in all of your houses.”
0	I wonder why Mgr.
0	Benelli did not communicate this condition to me before our meeting.
0	[2] He could have done so.
0	For example, one year ago three cardinals sent me a letter (Cardinals Wright, Tabera [Arturo Carinal Tabera Araoz, one of the Council Fathers MJM], and Gabriel-Marie Garrone) telling me (in effect) that I must close the seminaries.
1	Well, I refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church.
1	Because now they are destroying the Church.
1	When I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, “You destroyed the Church.” I refused to contribute to the destruction of the Church.
0	I am sure that my seminaries are contributing to the restoration of the Church.
0	I do not destroy the Church.
0	And so I said to Mgr.
0	Benelli, “No, I will not sign that writing.”
1	I think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council.
0	And do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?
0	When, then?
0	At the beginning of the Council?
0	No, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].
1	Pope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.
0	In [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
0	[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.
0	And what did these Instructions say?
0	The Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.
0	The Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.
0	The Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.
0	One day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.
0	And even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.
0	Pope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.
0	In 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.
0	He wrote in his book, Il Santo, that “We [modernists]…want a reform in the Church…without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority…even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.”[4] “The reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.” The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!
0	And I think…well, here we are!
0	In this time!
0	The reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.
0	And all they say is “Obedience, obedience, obedience.”
0	The Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [“the banner of revolution”].
0	They said that.
0	They wrote that!
0	One century before [the Council]!
0	Thus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!
0	As the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.
0	There were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.
0	Before the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.
0	The schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled “…On Religious Tolerance” and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled “On Religious Freedom [Liberty].” When we read these two schemas, we thought, “This is impossible.
0	How is it we can receive two opposing theses?
0	One says we must not tolerate error.
0	The other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.” And so, we go into the meeting.
1	Cardinal Ottaviani, standing, says to Cardinal Bea, “You have no authority to compose this schema, because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission.” As Cardinal Bea stands up, he says, “I do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty, and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.” Cardinal Bea, addressing Cardinal Ottaviani, further said, “I am opposed to your schema.”
1	Impossible!
1	We were in a very sad, serious situation.
0	Cardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.
0	He said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.
0	But before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.
0	Who is with Cardinal Ottaviani?
0	Who is with Cardinal Bea?
0	The conservatives and the liberals.
0	As the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.
0	This historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.
0	Isn't it time for you to subscribe?
0	And as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).
1	And now one month ago in Rome, the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry, the date of his inscription in Masonry, the date [of his rising to] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry, the date [of his rising to] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry, and the places where he [attended] the meetings of Freemasonry.
0	This Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.
0	That is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.
0	And now this is public.
0	Nobody has been able to refute the publication.
1	And so, we have (I am confident) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council.
0	Now, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.
0	That is not true.
0	Why?
0	Because when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council.
1	In the name of the Council!
0	It is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.
1	And if the reforms are bad, then it is impossible that the Council is good and all the reforms are bad, because that is the authentic interpretation of the Council by Rome.
0	Rome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform.
0	We can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council.
0	They know that.
0	And I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.
0	Even if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!
0	For example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom.
0	I have heard this (personally) twice.
0	The first time I was in Columbia.
0	When I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia.
0	[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.
0	They changed it.
0	They removed this article.
0	I read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.
1	The President said he is very, very anxious.
0	He said to the people, “even though we remove this article we remain Catholic.
1	I am a Catholic, I shall remain Catholic, and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country.”
0	Then, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was “progress,” “humanity,” “evolution,” and all the hubris of a Freemason.
1	And during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference, [the Secretary] said, “in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [of Vatican II], we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution.”
1	I met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia, and he said for two years they [had been asking] the President, in the name of the Holy See, to change this article in their Constitution.
0	But I will never…I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council.
0	Are you sure?
0	Yes, sure.
0	It is evident.
0	Now I said to the [Secretary], “As I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago.
0	The change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.” (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.
0	The Valais is Catholic.
0	And in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais – Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)
0	And [the Secretary] said, “Yes, I am responsible for this change.” Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?
0	What is this for you?
0	What do you say when you say “thy kingdom come” in your prayer, the Our Father?
0	“Ah,” the Nuncio said to me, “Now it is impossible.” What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?
0	“Ah, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.”
0	It is incredible.
1	And all in the name of the Council.
0	We must take care, because this change in the church is a liberal change.
0	The liberal principles have entered the Church now, and they destroy the Church.
0	If we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world…
0	[missing audio...]
0	The truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.
0	We say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, “Tu solus Altissimus,” “Tu solus Dominus,” “You alone are the Highest,” “You alone are the Lord.” But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.
0	We cannot say that.
1	Impossible.
0	We know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].
0	We must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth.
0	That is impossible.
0	And the change in the liturgy is very important.
0	It is very bad.
0	One of the principles of modern man, as they say now, “modern man,” is democracy.
0	And democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.
0	The authority comes from God.
0	Not from the people.
0	Not from the masses.
0	From God.
1	But today the principle, the democratic principle, is that the authority is in the people.
1	It is in the masses.
0	That is not true.
0	It is impossible.
0	And our liturgy is the school of our Faith.
0	It is the first school of our Faith for all people.
0	I was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.
0	I know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.
0	They can see what the priest does.
0	They can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.
0	And they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.
0	They know that.
0	That is very important.
1	But the change in the Mass destroys the Church.
0	Because we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.
0	The true liturgy is hierarchical.
1	It is not democratic but hierarchical.
0	Why?
0	Because we have God, the priest, and then the people.
0	That is hierarchy.
0	When we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.
1	That is hierarchy.
0	But now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.
0	The priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal.
0	That is a new liturgy.
0	That is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life.
0	We need the authority of God.
0	We need the Real Presence of God on our altar.
0	We need the Sacrifice of the Mass – not a meal only – but the Sacrifice.
0	So, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar.
0	That is the school of our Faith.
0	And slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates.
0	It moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].
0	I do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.
1	I do not say that.
0	But perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].
0	Recently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence.
1	They found that twenty-two percent no longer have the faith, the belief in the Real Presence.
0	But I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith.
1	No faith.
0	Last year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers.
0	This one priest came from France.
0	His uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.
0	The uncle had nine children.
0	The Bishop said to the new priest, “Now you can say Mass for your uncle.
0	Now you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.” The new priest said, “No, never.” Why?
0	It is not useful to say Mass for the dead?
0	“No, no, it is impossible.
0	They are already in heaven.” This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.
0	They are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything.
1	They learn nothing now.
0	Another example.
0	Recently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris.
0	One of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student.
0	They told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.
0	I asked them, “Why do you come to see me?” They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris.
0	There was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.
1	During the meeting, the priest, before he celebrated the Eucharist, said, “Today we celebrate the Eucharist, but we do not believe in the Real Presence.” These two young men said “That is impossible.
0	We cannot remain in this seminary.” So, they came to meet me.
0	They said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.
0	They asked for admittance to Econe.
0	And I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.
0	But that is a new religion.
0	It is a Protestant religion.
1	That is a fact.
0	Perhaps you can say, “How is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change?
0	How is it possible the pope signed this decree?
0	Signed this constitution?” I don’t know.
1	I don’t know.
0	It is a big mystery.
1	A big mystery.
0	There are many proposed theological answers.
0	I cannot subscribe to all of them.
0	Some say the pope is not responsible.
0	Perhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible.
0	Perhaps, I don’t know.
0	Some say there are two popes [(a body double)].
1	I don’t know.
0	Some say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave).
0	We do not know.
1	We do know now that Bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy, and that he is an infamous Freemason.
0	And because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.
0	I don’t know.
0	We don’t know.
0	Now, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry.
0	No, you cannot say that.
1	It is possible, but we do not know.
0	But if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope.
1	Not pope.
0	Illegitimate.
0	I don’t know.
0	It is a mystery I cannot understand.
0	But the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that.
0	This pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.
1	He said, “The smoke of Satan has entered the Church.” But where are the men responsible for the destruction of the Church?
0	Well, there they are.
0	They are the men who destroy the Church.
0	We must show where they are.
1	Where is this smoke of Satan that has entered the Church?
0	I do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.
0	And I have these experiences every day.
0	I visit many countries.
0	I was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.
0	Then I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference.
0	Many people came.
0	Many people are confused.
0	What is happening in the Church?
0	They are anxious.
0	But many people say that we disobey.
0	Disobey?
0	Obedience is relative.
0	It is not absolute.
0	It is relative to the good, but not to the evil.
0	We cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.
0	We cannot obey.
0	It is clear.
0	And I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad.
0	The new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist.
0	And so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives.
0	They are modernists.
0	Whereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative.
0	So, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.
0	And we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist.
0	That is a fact.
0	That is impossible.
0	How can they do that?
0	I do not know.
1	I do not know.
0	I have not spent my whole life in Rome.
0	I do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State.
0	And I know that very well.
1	But I think that the devil is in Rome, as was said by our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of La Salette.
0	We must pray.
0	We must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.
1	Because if this crisis continues, many people will go to hell.
0	They lose the faith.
0	They cannot go into the church.
0	They abandon the faith.
0	You know that many priests have abandoned the faith.
0	Many priests have gotten married.
0	And many sisters have abandoned their congregations.
0	It is a pity.
0	And it is everywhere.
0	I was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress.
0	Cardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.
1	I read in the newspaper about a Mass Cardinal Knox celebrated during the Eucharistic Congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the Consecration were pronounced.
1	That is a sacrilege.
0	You cannot go to that Mass.
1	That is sacrilege.
0	This is a fact.
0	They also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.
0	They asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.
0	Ay.
0	Impossible.
1	Impossible.
0	No, no, no, no.
0	[applause]
0	This change is not accidental.
0	It is not superficial.
0	It is very deep.
0	Very bad.
0	It is against our faith.
1	Against our faith.
0	And so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome.
0	From Rome we expect only the good.
0	We do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass.
0	We need this adoration.
0	We need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.
0	Because all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass.
0	It is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.
0	He is King because he is God.
0	He is the Son of God.
0	So, He is King by His nature.
0	This is essential.
1	Essential!
1	And if He is God, we must give Him the adoration of God.
0	And so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth.
0	Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
0	Jesus Christ is God.
0	That is a fundamental truth of our Faith.
0	And it all depends on this Truth.
0	And we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].
0	They do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.
0	They are afraid of the truth.
0	That is very bad.
0	And it is the same in Rome.
0	I think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth].
0	When I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr.
0	Benelli told me he visits the pope every day.
0	He said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting.
0	Immediately, he said, he would be going.
0	So, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?
0	Because they are afraid.
0	Meanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.
0	Here, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:
0	Cardinal Villot said, “We are afraid if Msgr.
1	Lefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind.” Because [the pope] is not too sure; the pope is not man of true conviction.
0	He is a mysterious man.
0	We cannot give a definition of the man.
0	He expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite.
0	Some part of him will speak the truth.
0	Another part of him is open to error.
0	Very curious.
0	And they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] “you must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.
0	You must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,” then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.
0	And so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope.
0	It is impossible to admit me.
0	And I know the pope very well!
0	When I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year.
0	And during those eleven years, I met Msgr.
0	Montini.
1	I know him very well.
0	He received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope.
0	But, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: “No, impossible!
0	You must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.” But I cannot do that.
0	For me, if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church.
0	The Church!
0	So, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations.
0	For the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland – applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain.
0	Good young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.
0	And why?
0	Why do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?
0	They know that.
0	But still they come.
0	I ask them, why do you come to Econe?
0	You know our situation.
0	They say, “Yes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests.
0	We are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.
0	And so, we are Coming to Econe.”
0	And as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here.
0	We have very good young men.
0	I also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.
0	In six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest.
0	But these young men refuse to become protestants.
0	They refuse to become modernist.
0	They ask to become true priests.
0	And it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.
0	So, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties.
0	I think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries.
0	And we have confidence in God.
0	Since I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us.
0	Because it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself.
0	We now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York.
0	In Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters).
0	And I am building a seminary in Switzerland.
1	It is impossible to do all this without God’s assistance.
0	So, I have confidence.
0	It is impossible for the Church to change its tradition.
0	The tradition of twenty centuries.
1	That we cannot change.
0	The Church is tradition.
1	The Church is tradition.
0	It is not revolution.
1	I thank you for your attention.

0	Al Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC
0	Please help support us with cryptocurrency donations.
0	Thank you!
1	For decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.
0	But now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.
1	Earlier this week, I wrote an article about how “sexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress”, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had “forcibly kissed” and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.
0	The following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story…
0	I couldn’t believe it.
0	He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.
0	I felt violated all over again.
0	Embarrassed.
0	Belittled.
0	Humiliated.
0	How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?
0	I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.
1	I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.
0	But that was then, this is now.
1	I’m no longer afraid.
0	When the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology…
0	“I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,” said Franken.
0	“As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t.
0	I shouldn’t have done it.”
1	Needless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken’s very weak statement.
1	In fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions…
0	Guy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken’s apology on Twitter.
0	“That was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,” Cecil tweeted.
1	“Al Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.”
1	This scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.
0	And of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn’t exactly difficult to find material.
1	For example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.
0	The following comes from Breitbart…
0	Amid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar’s breast has also resurfaced.
0	Franken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.
0	But just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.
0	There appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past…
1	Franken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for “Saturday Night Live” that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.
0	Franken, at the time a writer for “SNL,” suggested one skit should play out with “60 Minutes” commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.
0	“’I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.
1	Then when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.’ Or ‘That’s why you never see Lesley until February.’ Or, ‘When she passes out.
0	I put her in various positions and take pictures of her,’” Franken was quoted saying.
1	The article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.
1	As much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.
0	Let’s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.
0	Democrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.
1	Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.
1	In my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in “Weinstein-level” behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.
1	There is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.
1	If you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.
1	It is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.

0	Things to Do in an Emergency: “What’s Your Trade?”
0	Well, it’s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?
0	McCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr.
1	James Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion… I know some people are, to put it bluntly, freaking out.
0	The anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call “the good bishops”.
1	Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the “Good Tobin” in contrast to the “Bad Tobin” and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark – got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, “Despite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I’m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.”
1	The replies haven’t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.
0	It’s clear that even the “good bishops” have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.
1	As I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that “the US bishops gave themselves a pass” on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter “a thing that brazenly shifted blame.” And it seems that though they’re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren’t having it.
0	We are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.
1	The Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are.
0	The McCarrick news – and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga – has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.
1	The scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.
0	Rod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.
0	It has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one “bad apple” or even only a “few” as the hapless “conservative” Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.
0	This is the result of a mass-collusion.
0	As our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, “We’ve got to stop pretending it’s just the progressive element in the Church.
0	The ‘conservatives’ are complicit, too.” In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.
0	Whether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the “New Church.”
1	A point that Dreher’s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don’t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat.
0	In briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].
0	When that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.
0	This is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.
0	As Dreher reported,
1	When predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates...
0	Gay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.
0	If they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared… And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.
0	Later, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.
0	When I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men — priests, former priests, seminarians — who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.
0	Nothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.
0	For many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.
0	I’ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.
0	How are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?
0	Where are they to live?
0	How are they to maintain themselves?
1	These are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.
0	As men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.
0	In short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest’s material life.
0	The bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.
0	And these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.
0	Moreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.
0	And with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.
0	He will remain a pariah even among the so-called “good” bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal… (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)
0	I have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, “We’re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don’t we’ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we’ll be homeless and penniless.
1	We’re unemployable in any other field.” And as much as we might be tempted to say, “Well suck it up, this is for the good of souls,” the reality is that these are not small considerations.
0	Many priests are getting older – many of them with health issues – and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.
0	Of course there are some who don’t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.
0	Some of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.
0	But I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.
0	I think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.
0	As one of them said to me, “The old arrangement was, ‘Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.
1	We’ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.’ The new arrangement is a perversion of that: ‘Keep quiet and go along with it all and you’ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we’ll destroy you.’”
0	So what do we do?
0	The Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.
0	As we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.
0	It’s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.
0	We need to start working together with faithful priests – while there still are some – to help them create practical material alternatives.
0	If we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.
0	The other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it’s time we all started taking seriously.
0	In response to the continued outrages of both “good” and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing “an escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.”
0	I responded: “And the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.
0	We could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.”
0	I am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.
0	This would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.
0	I started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]
1	“begging” those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house.
0	I responded that this was going about things the wrong way.
0	Catholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, “begging” the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.
0	First of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.
0	Let’s not give them that, OK?
0	There’s already enough “frissons of pleasure” in their lives.
0	Second, it’s simply not going to work.
1	In Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain… throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the “institutional Church” – that is, whose names are on the bank accounts – are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve.
1	The wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful.
1	They are, in short, our enemies.
0	They’ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.
0	They know it and it’s time we stopped imagining otherwise.
0	The other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.
0	There’s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.
0	No one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he’s a faithful Catholic.
0	We should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.
0	He should own a house or stand to inherit one.
0	Families have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.
0	And more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.
0	Among the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.
0	But most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.
0	How many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?
0	Change the oil in a car?
0	Rewire a house?
0	The standard cliché of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it’s not even worth memeing anymore.
0	How many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong “sexual orientation”?
0	Every one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.
0	Among the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.
0	That’s an economic asset that we can’t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.

0	It reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.
0	One kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.
0	This college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.
0	This is fine, good idea.
0	But I asked him what he knew how to do.
0	“Can you fix a bathroom pipe?
0	Do you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?
0	Can you drive a tractor?” This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.
0	There is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.
0	Does a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?
0	Wouldn’t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?
0	Or for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?
0	If you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.
0	I think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.
0	Young men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.
0	Simply put, they’ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.
0	This vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.
0	The next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I’m going to ask, “How sound is your investment portfolio?” The next candidate for religious life, I’ll ask, “Great!
0	What’s your trade?
0	What do you have to fall back on?”
0	I’m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we’re seeing elsewhere doesn’t sound like a bad idea.
0	Perhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.
0	Meanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.
0	That monastery in Germany is lost.
0	Those bishops want the property and they’ll get it.
0	What the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.
0	Bishops won’t protect and support good priests?
1	Then it’s up to us.
0	The Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?
0	We’re not helpless.
0	We start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.
0	Our goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.
0	I am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.
0	They took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.
0	Over a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.
0	Two trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.
0	The museum’s website tells us:
0	“Despite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.
0	With only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.
0	Equipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.
0	Twelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.” “Hermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing scholarly articles.
0	No items were lost during the evacuation.”
0	To keep up everyone’s morale, the museum staff, while bombs were falling and they and their patrons were equally starving, continued to give tours and lectures, describing perfectly the artworks that had been removed.
0	They understood the value of what they had, and did everything within their power to preserve and protect it.
0	Does this all sound a bit, well, schismatic?
0	Not necessarily.
1	Any bishop who can demonstrate through his actions and not just with his tweets, who can prove that he is still a Catholic and not a wolf, is welcome to join us.
0	But we’d be fools to wait for them.
0	Whatever you might think of Archbishop Lefebvre’s solution over the last few decades, it certainly seems inarguable that the “state of emergency” for which he was preparing has come at last.
0	And in a state of emergency, certain norms are naturally suspended.
0	The simple fact is that soon there are going to be “vagus” priests who have been thrown out of their ministry for maintaining the Faith.
0	There are going to be nuns and monks without homes, as in the England of Henry VIII.
0	I think it’s only reasonable that those who also want to maintain the Faith should reach out to them and offer what shelter we can.
0	What we have seen this week is making it clear that we can simply no longer sit back and “beg” bishops to maintain and defend the Faith.
0	It’s not enough now to go into seminary or a monastery with glowing eyes and a firm faith.
0	Sentiment isn’t going to be much comfort when the young man is no longer so very young and finds himself standing on the street outside the chancery with no skills, no money, no job, (no health insurance) and no prospects.
1	If it is true that we really are alone in this, then so be it.
0	Let’s stop lamenting and start doing practical things about it.
0	___________________________________
0	[1] Dreher and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis’ Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.
0	It should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a “difference of opinion” with the group’s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.
0	He joined in 1966, was ordained in ’78, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.
0	This period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.
0	Maciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion’s leadership was covering.
0	The Farrell family’s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.
0	A recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related “lay” organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.
0	After he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a protégé of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl.
0	So close is he to McCarrick that Farrell’s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor.
0	So, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.
0	[2] It should also be noted that in his book, The Dictator Pope, historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated, collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards.
0	The natural question, “Why does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him?” is now easy to answer.
0	Swedish PM does not rule out use of army to end gang violence
0	Sweden will do whatever it takes, including sending in the army, to end a wave of gang violence that has seen a string of deadly shootings, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in Wednesday.
0	Sweden’s murder rate is relatively low in international terms, but gang violence has surged in recent years and Swedes are worried that the police are unable to cope.
0	In 2016, the latest year for which official statistics are available, 106 people were murdered in Sweden, a country of 10 million.
0	But Swedish TV reported there were over 300 shootings, mostly in turf battles between gangs over drugs, protection rackets and prostitution.
0	Four people were shot dead in the first week of this year.
0	One man died after picking up a hand grenade outside a subway station in a suburb of Stockholm.
0	Law and order is likely to be a major issue in a parliamentary election scheduled for September with the populist, opposition Sweden Democrats linking public concern about the rising crime rate to a large increase in the numbers of immigrants.
1	“It would not be my first option to bring in the military, but I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to make sure that serious, organized crime is stamped out,” Lofven told news agency TT.
0	The government has promised police an extra 7.1 billion crowns ($880 million) through 2020, toughened laws on gun crimes and made it easier for the police to monitor private phone calls and emails, among other measures.
0	But a report by the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows increasing numbers of Swedes worried about crime with confidence falling in the police and the judicial system.
0	“People are shot to death in pizza restaurants, people are killed by hand grenades they find on the street,” Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said in parliament on Wednesday.
1	“This is the new Sweden; the new, exciting dynamic, multicultural paradise that so many here in this assembly ... have fought to create for so many years,” he said sarcastically.
0	ICE arrests 20 in Kansas City during 4-day operation targeting criminal aliens
0	KANSAS CITY, Mo.
0	— Federal officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 20 criminal aliens and immigration violators in the Kansas City metro area during a four-day enforcement operation, which ended Thursday.
0	During this operation, ERO deportation officers made arrests in the following Missouri cities: St. Joseph (6), Belton (1), Blue Springs (1), Independence (2) and Kansas City (6).
0	ICE officers also made arrests in the Kansas cities of Olathe (3) and Lawrence (1).
0	Fifteen men and five women, ages ranging 18-61, were arrested.
0	Aliens arrested during this operation are from the following countries: Brazil (1), El Salvador (3), Guatemala (6), Honduras (1), Mexico (7), Romania (1) and Sierra Leone (1).
0	Several of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included driving under the influence, child neglect, child abuse, drug offenses, fraud and larceny.
0	Four of these were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony.
0	Two overstayed lawful visits to the U.S.
0	All were amenable to arrest and removal under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.
0	The following are criminal summaries of some of the offenders arrested in the Kansas City area during this operation:
0	A 55-year-old, Mexican citizen who overstayed a lawful visit to the U.S. by more than 12 years.
0	She was arrested Feb. 26, 2018 in Johnson County Kansas.
0	She was previously convicted of child neglect and was sentenced to a year in jail.
0	She is currently in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.
0	On Feb. 28, 2018, a 38-year-old Mexican citizen was arrested in Olathe, Kansas.
0	He has a 2012 conviction for fraud.
0	He was issued a warrant of removal and was placed in ICE custody pending removal from the United States.
0	Depending on an alien’s criminality, an alien who re-enters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, if convicted.
1	“The continued results of our deportation officers underscore ICE’s ongoing and steady commitment to public safety,” said Ricardo Wong, field office director for ERO Chicago.
1	“As part of this operation, we continue focus on the arrest of individuals who are criminal aliens and public safety threats.
1	Because of the tireless efforts of these professional officers, there are fewer criminals in our communities.”
0	Pope admits Catholic Church has ‘long ignored’ problem of child abuse
0	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Monday asked forgiveness for child abuse crimes and cover-ups within the Catholic Church, admitting that the pain of victims “was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.”
1	The strongly worded statement came ahead of an Aug. 25-26 papal pilgrimage to Ireland, one of the countries rocked by clergy sex abuse scandals, and followed an expose of pedophile priests in the U.S.
1	“The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced,” Francis said in a Letter to the People of God, a rarely-issued address to the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics.
1	On Aug. 17, a Pennsylvania grand jury report, based on hidden archives of the U.S. church, named 301 priests from the state as credibly accused child sex abusers and accused church leaders of a systematic cover-up of their crimes.
0	The report “detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years,” Francis acknowledged.
1	“It is essential that we, as a Church, be able to acknowledge and condemn, with sorrow and shame, the atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons, clerics, and all those entrusted with the mission of watching over and caring for those most vulnerable,” he said.
0	“Let us beg forgiveness for our own sins and the sins of others,” he added.
0	In the run-up to Francis’ visit to Ireland, the head of the Irish Catholic Church, Archbishop Eamon Martin, said he expected the pope to meet with victims of clergy sex abuse and to promise effective remedies.
1	“I’m not sure what his words will be and I’m not sure that a simple apology is what survivors of abuse want,” Martin said in a BBC interview.
1	“If he expresses an apology, it needs to be more than ‘we’re sorry,’” he added.
1	In his letter, Francis repeated a famous 2005 quote by his predecessor Benedict XVI, who, a month before being elected pope, lamented “how much filth” there was in the Catholic Church.
1	“With shame and repentance, we acknowledge as an ecclesial community that we were not where we should have been, that we did not act in a timely manner, realizing the magnitude and the gravity of the damage done to so many lives.
0	We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” Francis said.
1	“Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.
0	Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,” he added.
0	Colm O’Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors’ group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered “Much stronger language than ever used before.”
1	But O’Gorman added: “(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.”
1	Like his predecessor, Francis has promised “zero tolerance” on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world — including in Australia recently.
0	In January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no “proof” against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.
1	Following an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims’ claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations.
1	According to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.
1	“Sixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn’t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else’s crimes,” Allen said in a Sunday column.

0	The JFK Cover-Up Continues
0	While the mainstream media was announcing for the past two weeks that President Trump was going to release the CIA’s long-secret records on the JFK assassination, I took a different position.
0	On Monday of this week, I predicted that Trump would make a deal with the CIA that would enable the CIA to continue its cover-up of the JFK assassination.
0	(See “I Predict Trump Will Continue the CIA’s JFK Assassination Cover-Up” and “No Smoking Guns in the JFK Records?”)
0	On Thursday, the day of the deadline established by law for releasing the records, Trump granted the CIA’s request for continued secrecy, on grounds of “national security,” more than 50 years after the Kennedy assassination.
0	Please, don’t start calling me Nostradamus.
1	A blind man could see what was happening.
1	Donald “Art of the Deal” Trump was obviously negotiating all week with the CIA, and he was obviously pushing to get what he wanted all the way up to the very last day.
0	On Thursday, the deadline established by law for releasing the records, the CIA undoubtedly blinked and Trump presumably got what he wanted in return for granting the CIA request for continued secrecy.
0	Time to buy old US gold coins
0	Some mainstream media commentators are criticizing the CIA for waiting until the very last day to make its case for continued secrecy.
1	Displaying their naivete, they demonstrate their lack of understanding about how things work in Washington, D.C. As I indicated in my Monday article, when someone in the federal government needs a favor from someone else, the someone else is going to ask for something in return.
0	JFKu2019s War with the... Douglas Horne Check Amazon for Pricing.
0	The fact is that the CIA put in its request to Trump for continued secrecy of its JFK records long before yesterday.
1	But “Art of the Deal” Trump obviously sat on the request, undoubtedly hoping that he could get what he wanted in return if he just continued holding out and conveying that he was ready to release the records.
0	Don’t forget: According to Trump’s own tweets, he had already ostensibly decided to deny the CIA’s request for secrecy before the Thursday deadline:
0	Trump tweet sent on Saturday, October 21: “Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.” Trump tweet sent on Wednesday, October 25: “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow.
1	So interesting!
1	Now, it’s theoretically possible that the CIA presented Trump with some earthshattering new information on the Thursday deadline that showed that the United States would fall into the ocean if Americans were finally permitted to see the CIA’s long-secret JFK records.
1	But how likely is that?
0	Not likely at all!
1	Instead, it is a virtual certainly that when Art of the Deal Trump sent out those two tweets, he was sending a message to the CIA as part of the negotiations: Give me what I want or I will release the records.
0	In the negotiations, both Trump and the CIA knew that Trump was in the catbird seat.
0	The Kennedy Autopsy Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
0	In the end, the CIA blinked, just as Trump knew it would.
1	Contrary to what the mainstream press is asserting, the records undoubtedly contain more incriminating circumstantial evidence that fills in the mosaic of a U.S. national-security regime-change operation on November 22, 1963.
1	That’s what the mainstream media, forever wedded to the official story no matter how ridiculous and illogical it is, simply cannot bring themselves to confront.
0	Trump knew that he had the CIA over a barrel.
0	As I indicated in my two articles this week, the CIA was between a rock and a hard place.
1	On the one hand, it could refuse to grant Trump what he wanted and let the records be released, which it knew would point to the CIA’s guilt in the assassination.
1	On the other hand, it could give Trump what he wanted and have to suffer the obvious inference that people would draw — that the CIA was continuing to cover up incriminatory evidence.
0	What did the CIA give Trump in return for Trump’s extending the CIA’s 50-year-plus secrecy?
0	We don’t know, but my hunch is that it pertains to Russia.
0	Here’s my next prediction: the congressional investigations into Trump’s supposed “collusion” with Russia are about to fizzle out.
0	That’s because I believe that the CIA, as part of its deal with Trump, will order its assets in Congress to cease and desist with respect to that investigation.
0	In my opinion, that’s the price the CIA had to pay in return for its continued cover-up of its U.S. regime-change operation in November 1963.
0	Notice something else about the deal that Trump has presumably made with the CIA: The secrecy arrangement extends only to April.
0	Ostensibly, the next six months are needed to carefully review the records to determine whether the records really to relate to “national security.” Regime Change: The JFK... Jacob Hornberger Check Amazon for Pricing.
1	Not surprisingly, the mainstream media isn’t even questioning that ludicrous notion.
0	For more than 50 years, the CIA has known why it has wanted those particular records to be kept secret.
0	During the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s, the CIA decided to keep these particular records secret for another 25 years.
0	There are bound to be lots of CIA memoranda detailing why it was imperative to keep these particular records secret for as long as possible.
0	Finally, the CIA made its request for secrecy to Trump at least several weeks ago.
1	The notion that the CIA suddenly hit Trump yesterday with a new argument as to why “national security” would be threatened, after Trump had supposedly already rejected the arguments that had been presented to him, causing Trump to suddenly change his mind, is, well, laughable.
0	So, why the April deadline?
0	Why not extend the secrecy for another 25 years, which is undoubtedly what the CIA wanted?
0	Because Trump obviously needed collateral to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the deal.
0	If Trump had extended the secrecy for 25 years, he would have lost leverage to ensure that the CIA complied with its part of the bargain.
0	Let’s say, hypothetically, that I’m right: that the CIA agreed to use its assets in Congress to shut down the Russia investigation.
0	To make certain that the CIA fulfills its part of the bargain, Trump would need the April deadline so that the threat of the records release would continue hanging over the CIA.
0	If the CIA fails to fulfill its part of the bargain, Trump releases the records in April.
0	If the CIA squelches the Russia investigations, Trump grants another extension of time in April.
1	Let’s state the obvious: The CIA records that are still being suppressed have nothing to do with “national security.” They have everything to do with covering up the CIA’s role in the U.S. national-security regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, which succeeded in ousting from power a president who was, in the eyes of the U.S. national-security establishment, engaged in actions The CIA, Terrorism, an...

1	that constituted a grave threat to “national security,” i.e., befriending the Russians (i.e., the Soviets) and Cubans and entering into peaceful coexistence with the communist world.
1	In other words, unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, who had absolutely no motive to kill President Kennedy, the national security establishment did have motive, a powerful motive, the same motive that motivated the CIA and Pentagon to target other political leaders for regime change or assassination around that time, such as Mohamad Mossadegh, Jacobo Arbenz, Patrice Lumumba (who Kennedy admired), Fidel Castro, and Salvador Allende.
1	For a more detailed analysis of motive, read FFF’s ebook JFK’s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne, who served on the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.
1	Immediately upon the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald, the official account was that this was just a lone nut, former U.S. Marine communist who decided, for no apparent reason, to assassinate Kennedy.
1	One big problem is the official story, however, requires a suspension of logic and common sense.
0	For anyone who has a mindset of conformity and deference to authority, that story makes sense because nothing is questioned or challenged.
1	For anyone who has a critical, analytical, independent mindset, the official story is filled with holes.
0	For example, how many communist Marines have you ever heard of?
0	Why would a genuine communist join the Marines in the first place, especially since the Marines had just recently killed millions of North Korean communists?
0	Why would a genuine communist join the Marines knowing that he could be called upon at any moment to go to Korea, Laos, Vietnam, Europe, or elsewhere to kill fellow communists?
0	How many communists do you know who like to kill fellow communists?
0	It gets better.

1	After Oswald supposedly tried to defect to the Soviet Union and promised U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow that he was going to deliver classified information to the Soviet Union, which was America’s sworn Cold War enemy (and former World War II partner and ally), U.S. officials permitted him to return home with a Red wife, without even one grand-jury summons or even an iota of harassment.
0	Think about Martin Luther King, John Walker Lindh, Edward Snowden, the U.S. Communist Party, or the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
0	Think about how the U.S. national-security establishment treats what it suspects are communists or traitors.

1	Don’t make me laugh.
0	Soon after the Warren Commission was established, Warren called a super-secret meeting of the commission to address information that had come into Warren’s possession.
0	That information was that Oswald was actually working for U.S. intelligence.
0	Yes, a spy, the type of people that work for the CIA.
0	That would make sense, especially given that the Marine Corps is a prime recruiting place for the CIA.
0	Semper fidelis!
0	Now, suddenly, all the circumstantial evidence in the Kennedy assassination falls into place.
0	It begins to make sense.
1	The mosaic starts to be filled out: They needed to get rid of Kennedy to protect national security and elevate Johnson, who had the same anti-communist mindset as the Pentagon and the CIA, to the presidency.
0	Unlike JFK, who had begun withdrawing troops from Vietnam, Johnson would The Man Who Killed Ken... Roger Stone Check Amazon for Pricing.
0	protect national security by sending more troops to Vietnam.
0	But to avoid detection, they needed a patsy, which is the term that Oswald used after his arrest.
0	They needed to frame someone for the crime.
0	And what better person to frame than a communist or an intelligence agent who the public would believe was a communist?
0	Part of the scheme, obviously, would be to establish Oswald’s communist bona fides.
0	That’s why he was sent to New Orleans, where, contradictorily, he would work for a right-wing business owner, work with a right-wing former FBI agent, and conduct a public protest in favor of Fidel Castro and Cuba.
1	It was also why he was sent to Mexico City, where he would be ordered to visit the Cuban and Soviet Embassies, no doubt being told that he was being prepared for an important mission, maybe to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro.
1	But no government operation ever goes perfectly.
1	Things obviously went dreadfully wrong with the Mexico City operation because the investigation into it after the assassination was quickly shut down.
1	Today, it remains shrouded in mystery.
0	And guess what is included in the records that Trump has now agreed to continue suppressing.
0	You guessed it!
0	The CIA’s records relating to Mexico City!
1	Ever since the assassination, the CIA has argued that the release of any of its JFK records would threaten “national security.” One thing is for sure and undeniable: Despite the release of many of the CIA’s records in the 1990s and yesterday, the United States did not fall into the ocean or fall to the communists.
0	And neither would it have done so if Trump had not granted the CIA’s request for a continued cover-up of what it did on November 22, 1963.

0	As Honduran Caravan Reaches The Border, Trump Threatens To Send In The Military
0	President Donald Trump has threatened to send the military to the United States’ southern border with Mexico to stop a caravan of illegal immigrants coming from Honduras.
0	As of now, the migrant caravan has grown in size to over 4,000 people.
1	“I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught – and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump wrote of the caravan in a series of tweets on Twitter.
0	….In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught – and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..
0	— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018
0	According to Breitbart, the caravan of migrants that began in Honduras has grown to several thousand people after passing into Guatemala as it heads for the Mexican border.
0	Other Hondurans are leaving the country to join the caravan of illegal immigrants attempting to illegally enter the United States against president Trump’s wishes.
1	I am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018
0	Trump also threatened to stop all federal foreign aid payments to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador if the countries failed to block the flow of illegal immigrants and blamed Democrats for rejecting a reform of immigration laws allowing them to claim asylum.
0	He also claimed that the caravan included criminals.
0	Trump appeared willing to end his new trade deal with Mexico as well if the caravan was not stopped.
1	….The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA.
1	Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border.
0	All Democrats fault for weak laws!
0	— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018
0	According to NBC News, the caravan has increased in size to over 4,000.
0	The media outlet also reported that the Mexican government has sent 500 additional federal police to its border with Guatemala in anticipation of their arrival, according to U.S. government documents obtained by NBC News.
0	Part of the caravan, which has split into two groups, is approaching the Mexico-Guatemala border amid a surge in border crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border.
0	In September, U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 41,400 undocumented immigrants, up from 37,544 in August, according to numbers not yet released publicly but obtained by NBC News.
0	The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the numbers of families and children traveling on their own surged to record levels in September.
0	Another Sound Weapon Used To ATTACK US Diplomats: This Time In China
0	A United States government employee assigned to the American consulate in Guangzhou, China suffered a mild traumatic brain injury similar to those reported by diplomats in Cuba.
0	The unnamed worker reported, “subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure.”
0	The government employee experienced the symptoms from late 2017 until April of 2018, according to the U.S. State Department.
0	“The employee was sent to the United States for further evaluation.
0	On May 18, 2018, the Embassy learned that the clinical findings of this evaluation matched mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI),” Jinnie Lee, U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Beijing, told Gizmodo by email.
0	“The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures,” Lee continued.
0	But this isn’t the first time a sound weapon has been used on American diplomats.
0	Cuba has been accused of using a similar device to cause brain trauma in Americans at the embassy in Havana.
0	It all started in the fall of 2016.
0	Several of the affected diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of Barack Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.
0	The Daily Mail reported that one diplomat described being jolted awake in a Havana hotel room by a grinding, blaring cacophony.
0	When he moved a few feet across the room, the noise stopped.
1	When he got back into bed, the agonizing sound hit him again; as if, he told doctors, he had walked through some invisible wall cutting straight down the middle of his room.
0	Whether they heard anything or not, the consequences have been unmistakable — symptoms ranging from nosebleeds, nausea, dizziness and severe headaches to mild brain damage and permanent hearing or memory loss.
0	Oddly, as soon as some of the victims left Cuba, they stopped hearing noises.
0	–SHTFPlan
0	The mysterious illnesses reported by U.S. government employees in Cuba are allegedly thought to be either a “sonic attack” or perhaps malfunctioning surveillance gear.
0	It’s not known yet whether the injured government worker in China was targeted with any such device, despite reporting similar symptoms as the diplomats in Cuba.
0	The U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou says that it hasn’t had any other reported cases of strange sounds being heard by American officials, but is taking the issue seriously.
0	“If you have concerns about any symptoms or medical problems that developed during or after a stay in China, consult a medical professional,” the State Department said in a public release.
0	“While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source.
0	Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,” the release said.
0	The Cuban government continues to deny they attacked U.S. diplomats with a sonic weapon, and very little additional information is known about those who suffered through the strange ordeal.
0	After months of investigations, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been exposed to an advanced device that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences.
0	It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose.
0	Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles
1	Former Secretary of State John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump’s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.
0	President Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.
0	The JCPOA’s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran’s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.
0	Obama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.
0	Instead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.
1	Now that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump’s decision a "reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology" and to accuse the Trump administration of “lying to the American people.” It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.
1	The Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.
0	Moreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.
0	Had Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.
0	Congress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.
0	Congress should also consider whether time limits on Iran’s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran’s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.
0	It bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.
0	Kerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.
0	This turned out to be a lie.
0	After the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.
0	The Obama administration’s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.
0	The new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran’s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply “calls upon” Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.
1	Iran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase “Israel must be wiped out” emblazoned on the sides.
0	The commander of Iran’s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was "neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.
0	This is not a breach of the JCPOA.”
0	Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.
0	“A call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,” the Russian ambassador said.
0	In short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.
0	Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal’s terms then still being negotiated, “you will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has."
0	Rhodes claimed that “if we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.
1	So if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.” This was another lie.
1	After the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.
0	“We never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,” Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.
0	The JCPOA’s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran’s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.
0	Iran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA’s satisfaction.
0	IAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.
0	The problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.
0	IAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.
0	The IAEA’s explanation for not visiting any of Iran’s known military sites is that it had “no reason to ask” for access.
0	Evidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA’s finalization in 2015.
0	The IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.
0	“Nobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,” said Iran’s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.
0	Intimidation works.
0	The IAEA knows not to ask.
1	As to the JCPOA’s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.
0	Kerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA “never sunsets.
0	There’s no sunset in this agreement.”
0	This month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.
0	He claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a “misnomer,” before then defending the JCPOA’s time limits.
0	"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran’s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,” Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.
1	In other words, let’s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.
0	In the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.
0	Kerry declared, “15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.”
1	John Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called “strategic patience.” The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea’s nuclear program at its inception.
0	Instead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of naïve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.
1	It is precisely because North Korea’s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.
0	America’s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.
0	British Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.
0	They said that the nuclear deal with Iran was “the culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.
1	Therefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.”
0	Perhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.
1	Appeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.
1	Homeschooling Protects Children from Violence and Marxism
1	The February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida prompted many parents to consider homeschooling.
1	This is hardly surprising, as the misnamed federal “Gun-Free Schools” law leaves schoolchildren defenseless against mass shooters.
1	Removing one’s children from government schools seems a rational response to school shootings.
1	School shootings are not the only form of violence causing more parents to consider homeschooling.
1	Many potential homeschooling parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively protect children from bullying by other students.
1	Of course, many parents choose homeschooling as a means of protecting their children from federal education “reforms” such as Common Core.
1	Other parents are motivated by a desire to protect their children from the cultural Marxism that has infiltrated many schools.

1	The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the dumbing down of public education.
0	Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education.
1	Even if cultural Marxism did not dumb down education, concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents’ political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool.
0	Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government.
0	For example, how many government schools teach the Austrian economics explanation for the Great Depression — much less question the wisdom of central banking — or critically examine the justifications for America’s hyper-interventionist foreign policy?
1	Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should consider looking into my homeschooling curriculum.
1	The Ron Paul Curriculum provides students with a well-rounded education that includes rigorous programs in history, mathematics, and the physical and natural sciences.
0	The curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance.
0	Students can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses.
1	Another feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses.
0	The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty.
1	However, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education.
1	While government schools — and even many private schools — pretend religion played no significant role in history, my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization.
0	However, the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum.
0	Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other.
0	The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting.
1	Concern about the safety of students in government-run schools is one reason many parents are considering homeschooling, but it is not the only reason.
1	Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been dumbed down by federal initiatives like Common Core.
1	Other parents do not wish to have their children indoctrinated with views that contradict the parents’ political, social, or even religious beliefs.
1	I encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools —alternatives that provide children with a well-rounded education that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty — to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my homeschooling program.

0	Virginia man who wanted to join ISIS pleads guilty to lying about overseas trip
0	NORFOLK, Va. — While texting with an FBI informant in September 2016, a Williamsburg man expressed admiration for a U.S. Army officer who shot and killed 13 soldiers on Fort Hood, Texas, according to court documents.
0	Later that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force.
1	And in the application process, he lied to military recruiters about a recent trip he'd taken to Jordan in a failed attempt to make contact with the Islamic State and join a "real Muslim Army," the documents said.
0	Patel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements.
0	He faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4.
0	According to court documents and prosecutors, Patel – who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago – traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English.
0	While there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims.
0	His employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said.
0	Jordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later.
0	It's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State.
0	A search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China.
0	Jordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation.
0	On Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit.
0	There, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State.
1	He explained he went to Jordan in part to find like-minded Muslims, and because he wanted to do something “bigger, better, and more purposeful” – like dying in the cause of Allah.
0	But, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad.
1	In the course of their conversations, Patel discussed his desire to see a holy war between Muslims and non-Muslims.
0	He also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group’s flag.
0	He said he wanted to replace his neighbor’s American flag with it.
0	Patel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016.
0	Shortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations – like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices.
0	While back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source.
0	He texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood.
0	In the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky.
1	He also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.
0	Court documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.
0	Simply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.
0	Patel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.
0	Court documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.
0	Before Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.
0	During the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims.
1	Patel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one.
0	After Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport "near" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.

0	Patrick J. Buchanan: Sorry, Jeff Flake, It's Trump's Party Now!
0	| Articles
0	More is now required of us than to put down our thoughts in writing, declaimed Jeff Flake in his oration against President Trump, just before he announced he will be quitting the Senate.
0	Though he had lifted the title of his August anti-Trump polemic, "Conscience of a Conservative," from Barry Goldwater, Jeff Flake is no Barry Goldwater.
1	Goldwater took on the GOP establishment in the primaries, voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defiantly declared, "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice," and then went down to defeat battling to the end after the assassination of JFK made LBJ invincible.
1	The real "Mr. Conservative" was a true profile in courage.
0	Flake, with only 18 percent approval in Arizona, decided to pack it in rather than get waxed in his own primary.
1	With Falstaff, Flake appears to believe that "discretion is the better part of valor."
1	Sen. Bob Corker is another summertime soldier calling on colleagues to stand and fight Trump while he retires to Tennessee.
1	It's no wonder the establishment is viewed with such derision.
1	Flake calls Trump "dangerous to our democracy."
0	But the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment's control of the party's agenda and the party's destiny.
0	U.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role.
1	Yet, beneath the savagery of the uncivil war in the party lies more than personal insults and personality clashes.
1	This is a struggle about policy, about the future.
1	And Trump is president because he read the party and the country right, while the Bush-McCain Republican establishment had lost touch with both.
1	How could the Beltway GOP not see that its defining policies — open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention in foreign lands for ideological ends — were alienating its coalition?
1	What had a quarter century of Bushite free trade produced?
0	About $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs.
1	We imported goods "Made in China," while exporting our future.
0	U.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia.
1	Could Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers' wages had failed to rise for decades?
1	What did the democracy crusades "to end tyranny in our world" accomplish?
1	Thousands of U.S. dead, tens of thousands of wounded, trillions of dollars sunk, and a Mideast awash in blood from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen, with millions uprooted and homeless.
0	Yet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this.
1	With the Cold War over for a quarter of a century, what is the case now for America, $20 trillion in debt, going abroad in search of monsters to destroy?
0	Consider.
1	Bush-Obama "open borders" brought in tens of millions of Third World peoples, legally and illegally, to rising resistance from Americans forced to bear the economic and social costs.
0	What was the GOP establishment's reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here?
1	To call them nativists and parade their moral superiority.
1	Flake and Corker are being beatified by the Beltway elites, and George W. Bush and John McCain celebrated for their denunciations of Trumpism.
1	Yet no two people are more responsible for the blunders of the post-Cold War era than McCain and Bush.
1	About which of half a dozen wars were they right?
1	Yesterday's New York Times recognized Trump's triumph:
1	"Despite the fervor of President Trump's Republican opponents, the president's brand of hard-edged nationalism—with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration—is taking root within his adopted party."
0	Moreover, a new question arises:
1	Can the GOP establishment believe that if Trump falls, or they bring him down, they will inherit the estate and be welcomed home like the Prodigal Son?
1	Do they believe their old agenda of open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism and democracy-crusading can become America's agenda again?
1	Trumpism is not a detour, after which we can all get back on the interstate to the New World Order.
0	For though unpleasant, it is not unfair to say that if there was one desire common to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump voters, it was be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us.
1	Should Trump fall, and a restored establishment attempt to reimpose the old policies, there will be a truly uncivil war in this country.
1	After the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back.
1	As that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe, put it, "You can't go home again."
0	Traditionalists have been told that for years.
0	Now it's the turn of the GOP establishment to learn the truth as well.
0	Goldwater lost badly, but the establishment that abandoned him never had its patrimony restored.
0	It was the leaders they abhorred, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, to whom the future belonged.
0	Patrick J. Buchanan needs no introduction to VDARE.COM readers; his books State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America, and Suicide of a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?
0	are available from Amazon.com.
0	Patrick J. Buchanan is the author of “The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority.

1	Archbishop Viganò Speaks, the Neo-Catholics Panic
0	In his eleven-page account, affirmed under oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio’s “Council of Cardinals”, covered up McCarrick’s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.
1	This article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli’s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as “neo-traditionalism.” As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN’s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016).
1	Faggioli’s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.
0	Regarding Bergoglio, Viganò testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick’s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses).
0	Evidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a “trusted counselor” who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.
1	All of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally—only weeks ago—took decisive action against his “trusted counselor.” McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio’s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported “same-sex marriage,” and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990.
1	As Edward Pentin notes: “all 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.”
0	Viganò concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.
0	As to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:
1	I want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church’s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.
0	At the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: “Everyone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...
0	If we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.
1	We need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.” [emphasis in original] If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church’s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.
1	He followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.
1	And how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!
0	[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.
1	Indeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ’s flock.
1	In this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick’s abuses and resign along with all of them.
0	[emphasis in original]
0	Before he was papal nuncio in Washington, Viganò headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.
0	In those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.
1	With Viganò’s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again.
1	Even before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation.
1	Yet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous “reforms” that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century.
1	Those “reforms” included abandonment of the Vatican’s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that “advancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.” Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.
1	Kill the Messenger
1	I suspect that not even Viganò’s historic testimony will change the neo-Catholic position.
1	Quite the contrary, I would expect the neo-Catholic commentariat either to ignore Viganò’s witness, explain away his revelations or, failing that, make every effort to smear the man.
0	The campaign to discredit Archbishop Viganò began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.
1	Only hours after Viganò’s sworn testimony appeared online, the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters, writing for National Catholic Reporter, smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law, as “a trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact, fiction and venom,” “more than a little obsessed with homosexuality”—like Oliver Stone, who “was obsessed with the grassy knoll”—“a disgruntled former employee” and “always a crackpot.” Without addressing the merits, Winters dismissed Archbishop Viganò’s “wild claims” about bishops who are “subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality” and accused the Archbishop, along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops, of “speak[ing] about gay people with such hatred…”
1	Winters issues the dire warning that “A putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not, as a body, stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours, we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops’ meeting in November.
1	The enemies of Francis have declared war.” Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies, but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity.
0	John Allen’s instant analysis attempting to impeach Viganò’s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.
1	His opinion is: “Take it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.” Which is just Allen’s more nuanced way of saying: “Don’t believe it.” Allen’s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Viganò’s account implicates “no fewer than 32 senior churchmen” (so what?
1	), that he “has a history” of “innuendo and conspiracy theories” (a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity), that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed (an allegation Viganò has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents, but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy) and that Allen has “the impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind” (the same “conspiracy theory” mentality he gratuitously attributes to Viganò).
1	Mark Shea, easily the most insufferable of the neo-Catholic polemicists, has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Viganò ’s claims.
1	Ignoring eleven pages of detail, written and published under oath, he suggests there has been no “Documentation.
0	Evidence.
1	Proof.” Yes, Francis should resign if Viganò ’s allegations are true, Shea admits—a stunning concession coming from him.
1	Yet, making no attempt to refute Viganò’s account on the merits, he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument—puerile mockery: “But at present, the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor, not against it.” Shea’s ever-expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack: Well, if those people believe it, it can’t be true.
1	The neo-Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness, however.
0	Speaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-François Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that “Viganò said the truth.
1	That’s all,” when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict—sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage.
0	Furthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Viganò’s character and credibility:
0	- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Viganò’s allegations credible.
1	- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona, issued a statement affirming that he has known Viganò for 39 years, has “always known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity” and that his testimony should “be taken seriously by all…”
1	- Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit, Michigan issued a statement calling Viganò’s account “another daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the Church’s leadership, during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity.” (The statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website.)
0	- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: “Archbishop Viganò confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God.
0	There is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.”
1	- Cardinal Raymond Burke’s statement declares: “The declarations made by a prelate of the authority of Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the Church.”
1	- [And just two days ago, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which "speaks to Vigano's integrity and sincere love of the Church."]
1	In another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Viganò’s testimony, the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Viganò himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict’s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because, as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms, at Viganò’s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio’s election.
1	The Herald asks the obvious question: “[I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions, and unaware of the reason for them, why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand?” The question answers itself, and Viganò’s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl’s own spokesman.
0	Bergoglio Pleads the Fifth
0	Bergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Viganò’s testimony.
0	During the return flight from Dublin after the “World Meeting of Familes,” he was asked to comment on Viganò ’s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick’s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.
0	Bergoglio declined to incriminate himself:
0	Read the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.
0	I am not going to say a word about this.
0	I believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.
0	It is an act of trust.
0	When a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.
0	It will do you all good, really.
1	In other words, as Bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying, he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away—with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea, who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio’s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him “seems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless…”.
0	Seems to be.
0	Obviously.
1	The American “Gay” Church Expansion
0	While events have overtaken Faggioli’s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.
1	That polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival.
0	But before I address Faggioli’s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Viganò’s testimony.
1	First of all, as I predicted 16 years ago, because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre-conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary “a new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed—and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church.” That prediction came immediately after the “pedophile summit” of 2002 in Rome, which I attended as The Remnant’s correspondent.
1	In answer to my question then head of the USCCB, Wilton Gregory, made an explosive admission reportedby the international press: “it is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.” The struggle, to the extent there even was one, obviously has been lost.
1	Sixteen years later, the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world, stripped of his cardinal’s hat and deprived of any ministry, but only after international media coverage of the Vatican’s semi-secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago.
1	If not for that one case, McCarrick’s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ, including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio.
1	The telling details of Archbishop Viganò’s testimony concerning Bergoglio’s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose—details conveniently ignored by Winters, Allen and Shea—are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio.
0	This would explain why he will not a “say a word about” Viganò’s charges against him.
0	The Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he “was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.” Viganò further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Viganò himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:
0	I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.
1	The Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.
1	Viganò testifies that on June 23, 2013, he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope’s residence three days earlier, during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph: “The Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China” (evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio’s planned sellout of China’s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing).
0	Viganò wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.
0	During the audience Bergoglio queried: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” and Viganò replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:
0	I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naiveté: “Holy Father, I don’t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.
1	He corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.” The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.
1	But then, what was the Pope’s purpose in asking me that question: “What is Cardinal McCarrick like?” He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not….
0	It was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis’s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews….
1	He [Bergoglio] knew from at least June 23, 2013 [the date of the audience with Viganò] that McCarrick was a serial predator.
1	Although he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick’s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.
0	It was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.
0	[all emphasis in original]
1	Before his long overdue fall McCarrick, as Bergoglio’s “trusted counselor,” had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual-friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful.
0	It was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.
1	And Viganò now confirms Tosatti’s allegation: “The appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.
0	Their names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.” That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.
1	Remnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002, when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo: accelerated degeneration.
0	As I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:
0	Cupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.
1	He is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure….
1	Let the thing die of its own excesses, for as the “little synod” [the 2002 “pedophile summit”] demonstrates, the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant, uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II.
1	For heaven’s sake, the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked.
1	From the Vatican on down, through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect, the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy, the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching, the Church’s militant opposition to worldly thinking, the traditional formation in seminaries, the religious orders, the missions, the trust of the faithful in their own priests—in short, the very life of the Church—and dare to call it a renewal.
1	We must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin.
1	Nor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling façade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.
1	As for William (“nighty-night baby!”) Tobin, after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark, Tobin, another episcopal booster of Martin’s pro-homosexual propaganda, promptly sponsored a “gay pilgrimage” to his cathedral in Newark.
0	And it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal’s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.
1	Farrell, yet another promoter of Martin’s homosexual activism, arranged for Martin to “welcome ‘gay’ families” at the “World Meeting of Families” in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned.
1	Finally, there is the appointment of the “pro-gay” Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego, concerning which Viganò reveals: “The appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: ‘Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.’ McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick’s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.” Like Cupich, Tobin and Farrell, McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin’s homosexual subversion of the Church, calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a “cancer of vilification [that] is seeping into the institutional life of the church.”
1	Emboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever, Martin, now backed by “Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy,” as Viganò testifies, is urging all the “gay priests” to “come out,” including those ordained since the useless “pedophile summit” presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house.
0	But Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin’s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.
1	As Viganò notes, it was Bergoglio who made Martin a “Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications,” even though he is a “well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families…”
1	“Father” Martin now confidently declares, sixteen years after the “pedophile summit,” that “The idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous.
1	Any purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.”
1	Martin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors, who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network, and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it.
0	A Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top
0	None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.
1	The spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals.
1	This is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio, who made a flagrantly active homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, “prelate of the gay lobby,” no less than head of his papal household.
0	Moreover, it was Bergoglio’s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan José Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.
1	When an apostolic visitation, compelled by mounting public pressure, confirmed the charges against Pineda, he was forced to resign, even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as “slander.” Viganò notes that “the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.”
1	Despite the fall of his friend Pineda, Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary, involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss, rejecting all the evidence as “gossip.” Concerning Maradiaga, who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation, Viganò provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio:
1	In a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.
0	This is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.
1	With these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops….. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga’s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See….
0	The Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.
0	First, he insulted the abuse victims.
0	Then, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.
1	On the very day Archbishop Viganò’s testimony was made public, Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy, to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily: “From the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals, homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.”
1	Archbishop Viganò now provides his own decisive summary of the situation, based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church:
0	Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote: “The problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.
1	The deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.” These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.
0	[emphasis added]
0	Defending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo
1	At this moment, the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption, and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Viganò’s call for Bergoglio’s resignation, including Laura Ingraham: “Too little, too late from Pope Francis in Ireland.
0	I stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.
1	Time for the laity to demand a new Shepherd.” Even Michael Voris, in a highly amusing example of leading from behind, has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline: “Pope Francis Must Resign.”
1	Nearly three years ago, seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established, this newspaper published a petition which states: “We your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls.
1	Failing this, would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church’s integrity?” Our petition was of course dismissed as “ridiculous” by the neo-Catholic commentariat.
0	Today, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.
1	From the neo-Catholic perspective, the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect: the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment, an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition, which growing numbers of young people are seeking.
1	Hence even before Archbishop Viganò had come forward, commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo-Catholic air raid siren.
1	Faggioli fretted that “[t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church” that could be filled by the “neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics” who “attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis.” Accordingly, he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against “a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense...”
1	For Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio’s resignation be unthinkable, so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled.
1	The Pope, he argues, is not “the CEO of the Catholic Church world, and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire.” No, Bergoglio cannot “simply fire” bishops.
1	Except whenever he pleases, as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals (Burke and Müller) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends, prompting even Crux to ask: “Does Pope Francis have an enemies list?” Then again, Francis even obtained the removal of his own “trusted counselor” McCarrick from the College of Cardinals, albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media.
1	So, according to Faggioli, the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media, is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene “gay culture” in the Church and replace them with orthodox, normal heterosexual males.
1	Francis cannot “simply fire” even Cardinal Wuerl, who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh, and who authorized payment of $900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography.
0	Wuerl, says Faggioli, “faces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry… while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases… It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol… beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.”
1	In other words, because his situation is “complex” Wuerl, unlike McCarrick, should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington, DC, thus maintaining a key bulwark against the “neo-traditionalist” threat.
1	Yet, as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents, Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it.
1	Here too Viganò’s testimony sheds light on the darkness:
0	….
0	I myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn’t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.
0	I also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.
0	I immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.
1	If, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?
1	His recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.
1	The Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.
0	Cardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.
0	Following a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.
0	Before forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.
0	The Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.
1	However, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.
0	I subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.
0	But the Cardinal knew nothing about it!
0	Cardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope’s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.
1	In doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.

0	What really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his “complex situation,” which is not complex at all.
1	Rather, what he views with alarm as an “essential element” of the context in which Wuerl operates is that “scandals are also the opportunity for the neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis….” Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption, financed by the faithful, than a single, young neo-traditionalist prelate!
0	But what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?
1	Quite simply: an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual-infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council, Bergoglio merely being the latest, the highest placed, and one of the last.
0	As Faggioli puts it: “In the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals.
0	They interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council…”
1	Just as Faggioli fears, many in the up-and-coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious: that the conciliar texts, for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching, opened the way to ecclesial disaster.
1	Because in those texts—above all Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae, Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium—the Council verbally prostrated itself before “the modern world” and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini (Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis.
1	To quote Paul VI, then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council’s close:
0	But one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.
0	Its attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.
1	A wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity….
0	Instead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.
1	The modern world’s values were not only respected but honored, its efforts approved, its aspirations purified and blessed.
0	[emphasis added]
1	Thus did Paul describe the conciliar “opening to the world” through which the world promptly invaded the Church, including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary.
1	In sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: “This neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy… and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.”
1	Rather than “young clergy marked by personal sanctity,” the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the “dialogue with modern culture.” It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty.
1	Any abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason—“Catholic Jacobinism”—if not criminal activity.
0	Faggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of “Catholic Jacobins” for “hate speech” than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.
1	“Homosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed,” Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece, “but the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots, well before Vatican Council II.” And how does the Church “address” a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation?
1	Faggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing—the final beachhead of the neo-Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime—is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a “neo-traditionalist” storm surge.
0	Faggioli’s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a “modern world” founded precisely on a rejection of the Church’s authority.
0	It is not about the Faith at all.
1	Rather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department.
1	For people like Faggioli, indeed for the tradition-hating Pope they blindly defend, the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo-Catholic polemic for what it is—a fraud—and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church.
1	That is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.
1	In this respect, what the neo-Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves—that is, the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see, to their horror, that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable, indeed apocalyptic, level.
0	A return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.
1	Irony of ironies, he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration, led largely by a youthful vanguard, of what is ever ancient but ever new.
0	For some, it seems, no price is too great—not even the good of the Church—to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.
0	Conclusion: The Fatima Connection
0	Long before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.
0	As to Bertone and Sodano, Viganò provides further vital testimony:
0	Nuncio Sambi’s report [on McCarrick’s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.
0	My two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.
1	As already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals — I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians — and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict….
0	Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.
0	In November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.
0	It is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.
0	He even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.
0	Sodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.
1	Benedict reacted, despite Sodano’s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.
1	It is no coincidence that, as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima, Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety, stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong.
0	Concerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Viganò’s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Viganò’ credits with diligently reporting McCarrick’s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict’s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:
0	We were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.
0	Sambi said, “Excuse me.” He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.
0	“Here,” he said.
0	“Do you know this book?
0	You should read it.” It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.
0	“Wait,” I said.
1	“You are the Pope’s representative in the US, and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote?” Sambi replied, “All I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book.
0	And in the end, we are all after the truth, aren’t we?
0	The truth is the important thing...”
0	The truth is indeed the important thing.
0	And the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:
1	As for the new things which we can find in this message today, there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without, but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church, from the sin existing within the Church.
1	This too is something that we have always known, but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way: that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church, and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance, to accept purification, to learn forgiveness on the one hand, but also the need for justice.
0	[emphasis added]
1	I believe that Archbishop Viganò’s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the “need for justice” in the Church.
1	Whether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history, the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church’s restoration.
1	This will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists, such as Faggioli, who, in typical neo-Catholic style, imperiously scoffs at the notion of “a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages” and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as “a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.”
0	I can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Viganò:
0	Two DREAMERs Caught Smuggling Illegal Aliens
1	Or rather, "Two illegal aliens caught smuggling less glamorous illegal aliens."
0	The distinction between the illegal aliens who benefited from Obama's illegal amnesty and other illegals has always been a matter of rhetoric, not substance.
0	And illegal aliens are not a racial or ethnic group.
0	They're an industry: an economic industry and a political industry.
1	If you legalize them, you move closer to legalizing all illegals.
0	Meanwhile DREAMERs continue violating the law.
0	In more ways than one.
0	Customs and Border Protection said the first smuggling attempt was broken up on Oct. 4, after Border Patrol agents stopped a car at a checkpoint on Interstate 35 and discovered two illegal immigrants from Brazil hiding in the trunk.
0	The driver of the car was from Guatemala, a juvenile who had been approved by the Obama administration for a DACA permit in 2016.
0	Three days later the same checkpoint snared another DACA recipient from Mexico smuggling an illegal immigrant from Mexico in his trunk.
0	Neither of the Dreamers’ names were released.
0	They and the illegal immigrants they were trying to smuggle are all being processed for deportation, CBP said.

0	Last week, the Florida Department of State asked federal prosecutors to look into alterations made on official election documents from the 2018 midterms.
0	Politico reported that the department points to the Florida Democratic Party for changing dates on forms used to amend absentee and mail-in ballots.
0	These ballots would have been flagged for missing information or for being filled out with incorrect information.
0	The amending forms, called “cure affidavits,” were due at 5 p.m on Nov. 5, the evening before Election Day, at the latest.
0	During pre-Election Day absentee and mail-in voting, political parties have access to lists of people whose mail-in ballots were rejected for errors.
0	Meanwhile, cure affidavits are publicly available and anyone can send them to voters to prompt them to “fix” their ballots.
0	According to Politico, the DOS released affidavits on Tuesday, which demonstrate that four different counties said the ballots could be returned by 5 p.m on Thursday, Nov. 8, past the official due date.
0	Among the counties involved with the altered affidavits is Broward, which has been a hotspot for controversy as many Florida races have led to a recount.

0	Politico reported that they received audio of a Florida Democratic party volunteer leaving a voicemail to a voter in Palm Beach County to revise their mailed ballot after Election Day.
0	Palm Beach County failed to make Florida’s recount deadline on Thursday.
0	Matt Dixon, bureau chief of Politico, tweeted on Wednesday that the Democratic party volunteer call came during Florida’s ballot recount after ballots were allowed to be amended.
0	“We are now doing a recount, so we want to make sure you let your vote be counted,” Dixon quoted from the voicemail.
0	It seems that Democrats may have called absentee voters about supplying them with cure affidavits after the permitted date.
0	It also looks like whoever sent out the cure affidavits physically changed the due date to say Nov. 8, instead of Nov. 6.
0	Bradley McVay, DOS interim general counsel, asked attorneys in Florida to investigate the conflicting dates.
0	“Altering a form in a manner that provides the incorrect date for a voter to cure a defect … imposes a burden on the voter significant enough to frustrate the voter’s ability to vote,” McVay wrote in a letter, sent on Nov. 9 and publicly released on Tuesday.
0	According to DOS officials, they are less concerned with the inaccurate dates, and more concerned with the fact that the cure affidavits appear to have been deliberately altered.
0	State officials turned over the altered forms to federal investigators.
0	Of the many allegations of ballot mishandling in Florida, this is the first that has been referred to the federal government.
0	While Democrats seem to have told voters they could fix ballot errors up to the Thursday after Election Day — these votes could not count.
0	It looks like Democrats may have hurt their own interests by misleading their voters.
0	They may have believed that they were supplying the correct information, but they still should not have altered official documents without verifying that they were right, which they weren’t.

0	US staffer suffers brain injury after 'sound' incident in China | Bangkok Post: news
0	An American flag is flown next to the Chinese national emblem during a welcome ceremony for visiting US President Donald Trump outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov 9, 2017.
0	(AP file photo)
0	BEIJING: The US embassy in China issued a health alert Wednesday after a US government employee experienced an "abnormal" sound and suffered a mild brain injury -- in an incident reminiscent of a mysterious illness that hit diplomats in Cuba.
0	US and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter after the employee, who was assigned to the southern city of Guangzhou, was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), said embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee.
0	In an alert emailed to US citizens in China, the embassy said it does not know what caused the symptoms or of any similar situations in the country.
0	In Cuba last year, the US disclosed that 24 diplomats and their family members had fallen victim to an unsolved mysterious attack that left them with injuries resembling brain trauma.
0	Ten Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered a strange illness.
0	"We cannot at this time connect it with what happened in Havana but we are investigating all possibilities," a US embassy official in Beijing told AFP on the condition of anonymity.
0	The embassy's health alert says the government employee "recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure".
0	"The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event," the message says.
0	US and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter, an embassy spokeswoman said
0	"While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source.
0	Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present," it says, urging people with medical problems to consult a doctor.
0	Lee said the employee experienced "a variety of physical symptoms" between late 2017 through April 2018.
0	The person was sent to the United States and diagnosed with MTBI on May 18.
0	"The (State) Department is taking this incident very seriously and is working to determine the cause and impact of the incident," Lee said.
0	"The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures."
0	The Chinese foreign ministry could not be immediately reached for comment.
0	- Cuban case -
0	In Cuba, the American victims had associated the onset of their symptoms with "unusual sounds or auditory sensations", a State Department physician told the US Senate in January.
0	Charles Rosenfarb, a doctor and director of the State Department bureau of medical services, said the symptoms were mixed but consistent with brain trauma.
0	The victims suffered headaches, hearing loss, disorientation and some loss of cognitive ability.
0	(Video YouTube/TIME)
0	Initially officials suspected the Americans had been targeted by some sort of acoustic weapon, although in public senior officials were more cautious, speaking of "health attacks".
0	Media reports have suggested that the FBI has not been able to verify any evidence to support the sonic weapon theory.
0	The US government has held Cuba responsible, arguing that Raul Castro's authoritarian state must have either carried out the assaults or at least known who was behind them.
0	The incident prompted the United States last year to withdraw more than half of its personnel at the embassy in Havana, which reopened in 2015 as the two nations re-established diplomatic relations that had ruptured in 1961.
0	Canada announced last month that it was bringing home the families of its diplomats in Cuba after a year-long investigation into the illness failed to reveal a cause.
0	"The cause (of their symptoms) remains unknown but could be human-made," the Canadian government concluded.
0	Canadian and US authorities had initially suspected a "sonic attack" or a "mass psychosomatic incident", but those are "now considered unlikely", a senior Canadian official said.
0	The symptoms included dizziness, headaches and a lack of ability to concentrate.
0	Unlike their American counterparts, however, no Canadian envoy reported hearing any suspicious sound prior to falling ill.
1	“It’s gotta be a set-up”: Neighbor of Las Vegas Shooter Claims He Didn’t Do It
0	This report was originally published by Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars.com
1	A caller to the Michael Savage radio show who says he was neighbors with Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock asserts that Paddock could not have carried out the massacre and that it was actually a “set-up”.
0	The man, a former Marine who called himself Rick, says he was Paddock’s neighbor between December 2015 and June 2016 in Mesquite, Nevada.
1	“I can tell you 100% this is not that kind of guy,” said Rick, adding that he would see Paddock every other day and that the two would go to a local bar and play slot machines.
0	“He never even told me that he owned a gun,” continued the shooter’s neighbor, adding that Paddock did not express any religious or political opinions during their conversations.
1	“I’m not a big conspiracy theory guy, but it don’t sit right,” said Rick, before making the extraordinary claim that the whole shooting was a “set up” and that Paddock’s body may have been left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting.
0	The caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a “lone wolf” attack.
0	As a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from.
0	Rick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff’s Office to relay all the information he knew.
1	Although the claims are intriguing, it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting, friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors, with some outright denying it to be possible.
0	If Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors.
0	However, the neighbor’s claims are certain to attract more attention given that no specific motive has yet to be uncovered for the shooting.

0	Tenth bishop signs ‘Profession of Immutable Truths’ in defense of marriage
0	NewsCatholic Church, Family, Marriage
0	ROME, February 6, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – His Excellency Elmar Fischer, bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria, has signed the “Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,” LifeSiteNews confirmed on Monday.
0	Bishop Fischer is the tenth prelate to sign the profession.
0	As has been widely reported, three bishops in Kazakhstan – Tomash Peta, Jan Pawel Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider – issued a Profession of the Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage on Dec. 31, 2017.
0	The profession was made public on Jan. 2, 2018.
1	In the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church’s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are civilly divorced and joined in a second union may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.
0	Ordained to the priesthood in 1961, Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990.
0	After serving as vicar general of the diocese from 1989, in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Felkirch where he served until 2011, retiring at the age of 75.
1	Bishop Fischer’s support of the profession comes one week after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world’s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.
1	“God decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,” Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.
1	Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world’s 5,000 bishops would be “a stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.”
0	Bishop Fischer’s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine bishops and one cardinal.
0	To date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession:
0	• Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia
0	• Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò of Italy and former apostolic nuncio to the United States
0	• His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy
0	• Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria
0	• His Excellency Rene Gracida, Bishop emeritus of Corpus Christi, Texas, USA
0	• His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur, Switzerland
0	• His Excellency Elmar Fischer, Bishop emeritus of Feldkirch, Austria.
0	Student says anti-Semitism still an issue in McGill student government
0	The McGill student at the centre of anti-Semitic allegations says he’s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week.
0	Noah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students’ Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.
0	They were since reinstated.
0	A report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions.
0	Boudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish.
0	After criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were “in fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.”
0	Speaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU’s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau’s clarification.
0	“I thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,” he said.
0	Jewish groups had criticized Boudreau’s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU.
1	The group was urging students to vote against Lew, and two other board members who were deemed to be pro-Israel, alleging “layers of corruption” within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members, then singled out three members of the board “who are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro-Israel discourse in Canadian politics, or primary organizers for the anti-BDS initiative at McGill.”
0	Boudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote.
0	While Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded.
0	Lew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government.
0	“There have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it’s certainly not over,” he said.
1	In the months leading up to the vote, there had been other anti-Semitic incidents, including a tweet by Igor Sadikov, an elected representative of students in McGill’s faculty of arts, saying: “punch a zionist.”
0	Among the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on.
0	On Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students.
1	“I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.”
0	In addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity.
0	Rabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students.
1	However, he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism “will have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant.”
1	He said McGill is not alone in this respect, as this is a continent-wide phenomenon within student politics.
0	Democratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an interview.

0	San Francisco Show Trial Sequel
0	Last week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.
0	The jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.
0	Many observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.
0	San Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate’s gun possession charge dismissed.
0	Gonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that “momentary” possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.
0	“If you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn’t be a crime,” Gonzalez told reporters.
1	The Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.
0	Gonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.
0	As he explained, “I think I was a product of affirmative action,” and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.
1	In San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as “The Great Left Hope,” and a hero to Bay Area radicals.
0	The La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA’s most high-profile Stalinists.
0	In 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
1	In 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in “traffic cone orange.” As Gonzalez explained, “This is a sentiment I think all of us have had.
0	You have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don’t like.”
0	In 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.
0	In 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.
1	“He has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,” Nader told reporters.
0	On that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.
0	In jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three “immigrants,” quite possibly false-documented illegals.
0	True to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.
0	So observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.
1	Garcia told the court Zarate was playing his own “secret version of Russian roulette,” and thus parroted the defense’s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance.
0	As it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.
0	In a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.
0	In another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.
0	This happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.
0	Garcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.
0	After firing, he tossed the gun in the water.
0	He said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.
0	Even so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.
0	Any observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.
1	Unlike Stalin’s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro’ trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.
0	Denunciations of “gun violence” were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.
0	As Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.
0	On the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.
1	In the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what’s best for all.
0	In this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.
1	As Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin’s victims, “the more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.”
0	Out for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.
0	As defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”
0	Since Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.
1	That explains the effort of “The Great Left Hope” to have his client’s felony gun possession conviction tossed.
0	Any observer of the case could believe it probably will be.
0	Et Tu, Benedict?
0	(Some Final Thoughts on Joseph Ratzinger)
0	Recently an editor of a “conservative” Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.
0	I declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.
0	It’s been five years, and I’ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a “courageous” act it was to give up the pontificate.
1	The consequences of that act have been so outlandish – even for people who are mostly OK with Francis – that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.
0	Editor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.
1	Dario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.
1	In no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that “there is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.” Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.
0	Our thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.
0	MJM
1	In fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope – a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the “filth” in the Curia and throughout the church – suddenly just decide to quit?
0	Why would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?
1	At the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.
1	These absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.
0	We cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.
1	Could we have been wrong about him?
1	And if so, could we have been this wrong?
1	For reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, “I’m tired.” There was some implication that he didn’t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn’t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.
1	The trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.
0	Of all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.
1	And since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?
1	This man whom we had believed a “champion of orthodoxy,” whom we thought we knew.
1	Error, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.
0	How content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.
1	After three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: “Your goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.” Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn’t lie:
0	So strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.
0	But this is not what we see.
0	There he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.
0	“Perhaps it was written for him.” Well, why repeat it then?
0	Why, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?
0	If it is a deception, why participate in it?
0	In fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they “miss” him have failed to respect him in one way; they won’t take him at his word.
0	Some insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn’t valid.
0	But we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.
1	And indeed, far from being an isolated “prisoner of the Vatican,” Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.
0	We have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.
0	There’s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn’t add up, it’s true.
1	All the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:
0	Why did you resign?
0	Ratzinger: “I was a bit tired and didn’t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.”
0	If you’re not pope, why do you still wear the white?
0	Ratzinger: “Oh, there wasn’t a black cassock that fit me.”
0	Why do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?
0	Ratzinger: “Well, I’m an ‘emeritus,’ you see…”
0	And where did this “emeritus” business come from?
0	Does it have any precedent in Catholic history?
0	What does it mean canonically and doctrinally?
0	Ratzinger: “…”
1	What was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided “munus” – with an active member and a “contemplative member”?
0	Doesn’t that just mean there are two popes now?
0	Ratzinger: “…”
1	And perhaps most agonising of all: “How can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?”
0	A few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.
1	Steve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:
0	Five years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.
0	And through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time – one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.
0	You may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.
1	He walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.
0	And still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he’s the only one who won’t be canonized.
0	Who is the real Joseph Ratzinger?
0	I have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, “Maybe it’s really just that he wasn’t who we thought he was.” I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.
0	I think we made the mistake of believing the press.
1	We were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.
0	We failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.
1	What the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a “progressive,” as the term was understood in 1962.
0	This reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council’s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.
0	Frings’ claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF – and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani – for the “conservatism” in the “schema,” the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops’ discussions.
0	After this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema – that had taken years to develop – be abandoned.
1	This was done, over Ottaviani’s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French “progressives” who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.
1	It has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger – the maverick “progressive” academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary – who wrote that speech.
0	Cardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:
0	“Joseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.
0	Frings, Archbishop of Cologne.
0	Blind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.
0	Now then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.
0	Despite a reply by Card.
0	Ottaviani, Frings sustained his critique.
0	“It is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.
0	“Card.
1	Seper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.
0	Ratzinger, who did not change, continues it.”
1	Ratzinger’s reputation as a “progressive” is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.
0	It went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church “never to return” to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.
0	In his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, “Should the Council be revoked?” and in response recommended the “razing of the bastions” of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:
0	The duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.
0	This implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.
0	Neither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.
0	Hence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.
0	It was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.
1	But to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.
0	His was the thesis – a mainstay of “conservative” ideology – that the “real” Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.
1	How ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had “destroyed” and would gain the media-generated reputation as an “arch-conservative”.
0	And it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.
1	With the “arch-conservative” “Rottweiler” Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?
1	What did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism – that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?
1	What did “silencing” by Ratzinger’s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity “priest-theologian,” courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?
0	Kung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?
0	Can we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?
0	Precious few.
1	But we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith – academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world – with never a peep of protest from Rome.
1	Moreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the “arch-conservative” John Paul II and the “Rottweiler” Benedict XVI pontificates.
0	Why did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?
0	Is it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?
1	The “progressive” destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet “arch-conservative”…
0	Indeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.
0	He was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological “left” after the 1960s while he stayed in place.
0	Perhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.
1	Perhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called “progressive” in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a “champion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy” by 2005.
0	Is this why he resigned?
0	Is it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?
1	Perhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the “liberal” European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the “Sankt Gallen Mafia” that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.
0	Fausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops’ palace of Milan in June 2012.
0	Martini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.
0	Apparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.
0	By 2012, this had proved impossible.
1	Why would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini – the “godfather” of the “liberal wing” of European Catholicism?
0	I think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.
0	They were esteemed academic colleagues.
0	They were brothers of the episcopate.
0	They were members of the club.
0	Any appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.
0	Why wouldn’t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?
0	Why is Walter Kasper a cardinal?
1	One of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these “conservative” prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.
1	It beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.
0	When, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.
1	Jorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the “ultra-liberal” “wing” of the post-Vatican II Church.
0	In an article on the cardinal’s life’s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.
0	The monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper’s work as Bergoglio’s.
0	This is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.
1	Jansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another “Sankt Gallen” member.
0	This was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.
1	But that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn’t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?
0	Why was he not – at the very least – given the same “silencing” treatment as Kung?
0	Kasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.
1	But it’s a simple truth: he’s a heretic.
1	Everyone knows he’s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.
0	After openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.
0	Remember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger’s CDF in 1993.
0	But he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.
0	Nor was he removed from places of influence.
0	Far from it.
0	In 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.
0	In 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the “ecumenical” office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.
1	In 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.
0	Then Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.
1	And, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger’s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.
0	As Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,
0	Cardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.
0	But since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.
0	(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)
0	Excuse me Maike, but I don’t think this is a parenthetical issue.
1	Is it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?
1	Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope “Emeritus” Benedict – whatever you want to call yourself – I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?
0	Why is he still a bishop?
1	Why is he still allowed to call himself a “Catholic theologian”?
0	Why did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?
0	Doesn’t anyone else want to know this?
0	Don’t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?
0	Why was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?
1	Why a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?
0	What are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?
0	My own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle’s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami’s Favalora, Rochester’s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool… I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.
1	For fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.
1	Why have we so often seen these men – compromised intellectually and morally – elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?
0	The end of “Big Umbrella Catholicism”
0	The New York Times’ Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.
1	Maike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation – in which each, of the so-called “Sankt Gallen Mafia” prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: “It was characteristic of the church’s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.”
1	When journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being – as his Wikipedia page puts it – “one of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.” And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we’re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.
0	There’s a “liberal wing” and a “conservative wing” and they’re both Catholic.
1	Steve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole “emeritus pope” charade was an error: “I think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn’t have.” In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.
0	By playing along, by pretending that we could be “conservative Catholics” in this New Paradigm that also includes “liberal Catholics” we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.
1	Because of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church’s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a “big umbrella” with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal “taste” …that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.
1	This schizophrenia is the model under which “conservatives” have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a “conservative champion of orthodoxy.” And what has this achieved?
0	It created cover for the men of Kasper’s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.
0	And just like that, the jargon of “tolerance” and the “big umbrella” is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.
0	As it had to.
0	They, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand – and frequently say out loud – that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.
0	And their New Church is the only one left.
1	For five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don’t talk about it, there isn’t a problem.
1	Ottaviani’s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church – and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.
0	We had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.
0	One of the things I’ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.
1	We were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the “New Springtime of Vatican II,” while we watched these wolves in shepherds’ clothing eating the sheep.
1	Now we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.
0	For those still wondering, Bergoglio isn’t a shock, he isn’t even a surprise; he’s just the logical end result.
0	This pontificate isn’t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.
0	Trump Orders Declassification Of ‘Russian Probe’ Documents, Including Texts
1	President Donald Trump ordered the feds to declassify documents relating the Russian election meddling investigation yesterday.
1	Among the documents to be declassified are all of the text messages between disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
0	The documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page.
0	Trump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News.
0	The 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format.
0	The June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.
0	According to the redacted version as reported by Fox News, three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled “The Russian Government’s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.” That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump’s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort.
0	White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump had ordered the documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department “[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency.”
0	The text messages are to be released “without redaction,” and those include messages from Ohr, Strzok, Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
1	Carter Page told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Monday night that the FBI’s investigation was “so incredibly stupid to begin with.” He added, “My biggest concern is all the damage that this did to the U.S. government [and] the mockery it made out of the Constitution and all of the wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice, the FBI and the DNC [Democratic National Committee].”
1	It is so far unknown when these documents will be declassified in an unredacted version, but it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now.
0	Fox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.
0	A Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the DOJ and FBI “are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President’s order.”
1	Sanctuary City Mayor Protected Illegal Alien Mexican Rapist
0	Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf claims to fight for women.
1	Except when she's fighting for their rapists instead.
1	A Democratic mayor’s warning to illegal immigrants of an incoming ICE raid in northern California may have led to a number of illegal immigrants with violent and sex-related convictions evading capture and deportation.
0	Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tweeted out an impending warning of the four-day raid last week, alerting targeted individuals to the imminent arrests, and infuriating Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, who say that many more could have been caught if they hadn't been warned.
1	A spokesperson for ICE gave Fox News examples of some of the unsavory characters who evaded officals during the raid.
0	One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), and had been deported in 2003.
0	Another who evaded capture had a conviction for sodomizing a drugged victim in 2012, as well as a DUI from this year -- that Mexican citizen had also been previously deported in 2013.
0	Another illegal immigrant from Mexico, previously deported in 2014 for a conviction for armed robbery, also evaded capture.
0	Cardinal O’Malley will head revived Vatican abuse panel
0	Cardinal Sean O’Malley has been reappointed as the head of a Vatican commission on child sex abuse, as Pope Francis on Saturday revived the panel in the wake of widespread condemnation last month of the pontiff’s defense of a Chilean bishop accused of witnessing and ignoring abuse.
0	The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors lapsed in December, when its members’ terms expired, prompting concerns that the advisory body could be disbanded.
0	In addition to O’Malley’s return as the panel’s president, Pope Francis named seven returning members and nine new members representing countries around the world, including Brazil, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, and India, according to a statement from the Vatican.

1	O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said in the statement that the pope had “given much prayerful consideration” to the membership of the panel.
0	“The newly appointed members will add to the Commission’s global perspective in the protection of minors and vulnerable adults,” he said.
0	“The Holy Father has ensured continuity in the work of our Commission, which is to assist local churches throughout the world in their efforts to safeguard all children, young people, and vulnerable adults from harm.”
0	Local survivors of abuse greeted the announcement warily, hopeful that there could be positive change in the church but saying the panel accomplished little under its first three-year mandate.
0	“The objectives of the commission when it was first announced, when it was just getting started.

0	Saviano said the commission is “a good idea,” and added, “I’m not particularly optimistic that much will get accomplished, but a commission is better than no commission.”
1	Given his long experience witnessing the church’s inertia on the issue, Saviano said, he has set his expectations at rock bottom.
1	“That’s kind of my attitude now: If I don’t expect the Catholic Church to do anything, then I won’t be too disappointed when they don’t do anything,” he continued.
1	Jim Scanlan, another survivor, said “the timing of it is too perfect” given the controversy last month surrounding Pope Francis’s remarks that accused victims of a notorious Chilean pedophile priest, the Rev.
1	Fernando Karadima, of “slander” against Bishop Juan Barros, who the victims say was complicit in a cover up.
0	The pope said he had seen no proof of Barros’s guilt, but the Associated Press reported that O’Malley and other members of the commission had in 2015 hand-delivered to him an eight-page letter from a survivor that graphically detailed his abuse and said Barros and other clergy had witnessed him being fondled but had not intervened.

0	Scanlan said his reaction to hearing that Francis has revived the commission was “hopeful but cynical.” Like Saviano, he said the panel accomplished little in its first incarnation.
0	“My expectation is it will probably have the same outcome, because the church is the church, and they do it for appearance, but they’re still going to go by their own rules,” he said.
1	“I’ve seen little that has changed.”
1	Scanlan said Pope Francis has given him hope for progress on some issues in the church, but on sexual abuse, he “continues to be blind to what the church has done.”
0	Last month, O’Malley denounced the pope’s controversial defense of the Chilean bishop.
0	Despite distancing himself from Pope Francis’s comments, O’Malley said that he has witnessed the pontiff’s genuine compassion for abuse victims.
0	“The Pope’s statements that there is no place in the life of the Church for those who would abuse children and that we must adhere to zero tolerance for these crimes are genuine,” O’Malley said, “and they are his commitment.”

1	No Justice for Kate Steinle
0	A San Francisco jury on Thursday found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, also known as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez, not guilty of the murder of Kate Steinle on a San Francisco pier on July 1, 2015.
1	The jury of six men and six women, including three immigrants, found the Mexican national not guilty of all murder and manslaughter charges and guilty only of felony possession of a firearm.
0	For Garcia’s Zarate’s attorney, Matt Gonzalez, Ralph Nader’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election, the trial was all about Donald Trump.
0	“For those who might criticize this verdict – there are a number of people who have commented on this case in the last couple of years,” Gonzalez said after the verdict, “the Attorney General of the United States and the President and Vice President of the United States.
1	Let me just remind them, they are themselves under investigation by a special prosecutor in Washington D.C. and they may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt, so I ask that they reflect on that before they comment or disparage the results of this case.”
1	“From day one this case was used as a means to foment hate, to foment division and to foment a program of mass deportation,” added defense attorney Francisco Ugarte.
1	“It was used to catapult a presidency along that philosophy of hate of others.
1	I believe today is a day of vindication for the rights of immigrants.”
0	Alex Bastian of the San Francisco prosecutor’s office told reporters the verdict “was not the one we were hoping for,” but the Steinle family could be forgiven for any reasonable doubts about the prosecution.
1	“We’re just shocked — saddened and shocked ... that’s about it,” Jim Steinle, Kate’s father, told the San Francisco Chronicle.
1	“There’s no other way you can coin it.
1	Justice was rendered, but it was not served.” Kate’s brother Brad was “stunned that they couldn’t even get him on using the weapon.”
0	Attorney David Wohl told Fox News that with negligent discharge of a firearm, the defendant’s action met every standard for involuntary manslaughter.
1	The verdict, Wohl said, was “an utter and complete and total failure by the prosecutor.”
1	Conservative Ben Shapiro told Fox news the verdict was “horrifying.
0	.
0	.
1	Politics trumps evidence in California once again.” For Jeff Sessions San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy “led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle.” According to the Attorney General’s statement, the Justice Department “will continue to ensure that all jurisdictions place the safety and security of their communities above the convenience of criminal aliens.”
1	For his part, President Trump tweeted: “A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case!
0	No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.”
0	Mexican national Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 54, is a seven-time felon and has been deported five times.
0	In 2015 federal authorities sought to detain him for deportation.
0	San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi chose to defy the feds and release the Mexican national.
0	On July 1, 2015, the criminal illegal picked up a Sig Sauer .40 caliber pistol, stolen from a Bureau of Land Management officer, and fired the shot that killed Kate Steinle, only 32 years old.
1	The Mexican nation and career criminal enjoyed all the rights of the American legal system, the presumption of innocence, and a high-profile defense attorney funded by American taxpayers.
1	During the trial, former vice presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez claimed that Garcia Zarate’s background and nationality played a role in his prosecution.
1	As Gonzalez argued, “If this was a college student or Swedish kid would he be charged with murder?”
1	That sort of politically correct nonsense plays well in San Francisco, so any observer of the case could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.
0	The felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.
0	Since Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.
0	San Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.
0	Should that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with violating U.S. immigration law.
1	He has already proved that in the sanctuary state of California, false-documented illegals are a privileged class.
0	Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, or whatever his real name is, has also proved that a career criminal who is not even supposed to be in the country can literally get away with murder in broad daylight.
0	When that happens, the killer’s public defender will call it a “vindication for the rights of immigrants.”
0	In San Francisco, and across California, this verdict will surely give new meaning to the cry of “no justice, no peace.”
0	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replies to Chris Ferrara
0	La Stampa’s Robert Fastiggi Replied to Chris Ferrara’s articles on Fastiggi and Goldstein’s defense of Amoris Laetitia and their criticism of the Filial Correction:
0	Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “Wait, Wait, It’s all a mistranslation!”
0	Robert Fastiggi • 13 hours ago
0	In the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the “official” Latin text rather than the “original” Latin text.
0	This, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS.
0	Mr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the “generous response” offered to God is a sin.
0	This, though, is not what AL is saying.
0	The generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.
0	I explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:
0	Posted on LifeSiteNews:
0	Prof. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases.
0	In his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that “God can be ‘asking’ someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.” Then in a Sept. 28 ‘17 LifeSiteNews article, he states that “the generous response” owed to God is “a certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.” Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains “this conscience” in AL 303, this proves that the “generous offering owed to God” is the recognition that one is living “contrary to “the universal command of the Gospel.”
0	Prof. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience’s recognition that “a given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel” and this same conscience’s subsequent recognition of a “generous response owed to God in the present circumstances.” The subject “conscience” might be the same but the object is different.
0	The “generous response” is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.
0	What might be this “generous response?” Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he’s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.
0	Moreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.
0	In our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil “marriage” recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.
0	We chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that “the generous response” could be the ending of a particular sin.
0	Our example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.
0	It’s really just the opposite.
0	AL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.
1	Pope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says “a small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.’”
0	In a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: “Imagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.
0	He still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.
0	The father is happy.
0	Is he happy about the fact that the child is sick?
0	No, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.”
0	This is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
0	God is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.
0	God, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction—even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.
0	This is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.
0	It is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.
0	Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago
0	I certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.
0	I certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.
0	Rather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.
1	With all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a “move away from sin” is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical.
0	What constitutes a “move away” from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?
0	No example is provided in AL because none can be.
0	The notion is nonsensical.
0	Just how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi’s claim that by “a move away from sin” in the case of a divorced and “remarried” couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.
0	But that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.
0	Such a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church’s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.
0	At any rate, the “brother and sister” approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.
0	As my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and “remarried” people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while “discerning” their situation, this “discernment” being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.
0	Thus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and “remarried” people who believe themselves to be “at peace with God.” And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, “there is no other interpretation.”
0	No amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience “without exception”---is being overthrown in place after place.
0	It is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.
1	A moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.
0	Robert Fastiggi to Chris Ferrara • 2 hours ago
0	Thank you for your response.
0	You write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.
1	I can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind.
0	Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 16 minutes ago
0	Tell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing.
1	Irony of ironies, the latter-day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion---while Francis does nothing but approve.
1	I think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind, but above all with open eyes, for you have clearly shut them to what is going in the dioceses in the name of AL.
0	Fastiggi’s exchange with Ferrara concerning “More Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.”
0	Robert Fastiggi • 12 hours ago
0	I would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.
0	I give him credit for his colorful style.
0	Unfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis “wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.”
1	He mentions the Holy Father's letter to the Buenos Aires bishops, but he fails to take into account that the statement of those Argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way, as Cardinal Müller told Edward Pentin in a Sept. 28 interview published in the National Catholic Register.
0	In fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of “access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.” This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.
0	The same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.
0	Pope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.
1	I have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases.
0	Once again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession.
0	With regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis.
0	Moreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks.
0	This seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.
0	As a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence.
0	As a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.
0	Beyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church.
1	He says that Dr. Goldstein and I are “foot soldiers of a Leviathan Church” because we defend the Roman Pontiff.
0	Does Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a “Leviathan Church” and not the Catholic Church?
0	If this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him.
0	This, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751.
0	I hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the “Leviathan Church” under Pope Francis.
0	A more simple question to him would be this: “Are you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?”
0	I apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.
0	I believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a “Leviathan Church” distinct from “the dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.”
0	Chris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi • 9 hours ago
0	If Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina—then I cannot help him.
1	As for my metaphorical reference to a “Leviathan Church,” I am afraid Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate literal-mindedness.
0	To make it clear for him, I am contending that he and his co-author treat the Pope as if he were the absolute ruler of Hobbes’s Leviathan.
0	I do not, as should be obvious, argue that this Leviathan Church actually exists.
0	That it does not and cannot exist is precisely my point.
1	Dr. Fastiggi’s inapt citation to Canon 751 and his clumsy and insulting questions about my “standing in the Catholic Church” and whether I am “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff” demonstrate a pronounced lack of comprehension of pertinent ecclesiological and theological basics, and a rather embarrassing lack of rhetorical finesse.
0	Raising objections to a papal document because it appears to depart from sound orthodoxy is hardly “refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff,” who has not, at any rate, actually commanded anyone to “submit” to anything via AL.
1	I respectfully suggest that Dr. Fastiggi’s comments evince a need for serious study and reflection before he ventures further opinions on this controversy in public.

0	The war for dominance in the Middle East, following the crushing of ISIS, appears about to commence in Syria—with NATO allies America and Turkey on opposing sides.
0	Turkey is moving armor and troops south to Syria's border enclave of Afrin, occupied by Kurds, to drive them out, and then drive the Syrian Kurds out of Manbij further south as well.
1	Says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, " We will destroy all terror nests, one by one, in Syria, starting from Afrin and Manbij."
0	For Erdogan, the Kurdish YPG, the major U.S. ally in Syria, is an arm of the Kurdish PKK in Turkey, which we and the Turks have designated as a terrorist organization.
1	While the Kurds were our most effective allies against ISIS in Syria, Turkey views them as a mortal peril and intends to deal with that threat.
1	If Erdogan is serious, a clash with the U.S. is coming, as our Kurdish allies occupy most of Syria's border with Turkey.
0	Moreover, the U.S. has announced plans to create a 30,000-man Border Security Force of Kurds and Arabs to keep ISIS out of Syria.
1	Erdogan has branded this BSF a "terror army," and President Bashar Assad of Syria has called BSF members "traitors."
1	This U.S. plan to create a BSF inside Syria, Damascus declared , "represents a blatant attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity and unity of Syria, and a flagrant violation of international law."
1	Does not the Syrian government have a point?
1	Now that ISIS has been driven out of Raqqa and Syria, by what authority do U.S. forces remain to arm troops to keep the Damascus government from reimposing its authority on its own territory?
0	Secretary of State Tillerson gave Syria the news Wednesday.
0	The U.S. troop commitment to Syria, he said, is now open-ended.
1	Our goals: Guarantee al-Qaida and ISIS do not return and set up sanctuary; cope with rising Iranian influence in Damascus; and pursue the removal of Bashar Assad's ruthless regime.
1	But who authorized this strategic commitment, of indefinite duration, in Syria, when near two decades in Afghanistan have failed to secure that nation against the return of al-Qaida and ISIS?
0	Again and again, the American people have said they do not want to be dragged into Syria's civil war.
1	Donald Trump won the presidency on a promise of no more unnecessary wars.
1	Have the American people been had again?
0	Will they support a clash with NATO ally Turkey, to keep armed Kurds on Turkey's border, when the Turks regard them as terrorists?
1	Are we prepared for a shooting war with a Syrian army, backed by Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Shiite militias from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, to hold onto a fourth of Syria's territory in alliance with Kurds?
0	The U.S. coalition in Syria said this week the BSF will be built up "over the next several years" and "be stationed along the borders ... to include portions of the Euphrates river valley and international borders to the east and north."
0	Remarkable: A U.S.-created border army is going to occupy and control long stretches of Syria's borders with Turkey and Iraq, over Syria's objections.
0	And the U.S. military will stand behind the BSF.
1	Are the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria really up to that task, should the Turks decide to cleanse the Syrian border of Kurds, or should the Syrian regime decide to take back territory occupied by the Kurds?
1	Who sanctioned this commitment to a new army, which, if Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies, and the Turks, do not all back down, risks a major U.S. war with no allies but the Kurds?
0	As for Syria's Kurds casting their lot with the Americans, one wonders: Did they not observe what happened when their Iraqi cousins, after helping us drive ISIS out of Mosul, were themselves driven out of Kirkuk by the Iraqi army, as their U.S. allies watched?
0	In the six-year Syrian civil war, which may be about to enter a new phase, America faces a familiar situation.
0	While our "allies" and adversaries have vital interests there, we do not.
0	The Assads have been in power for the lifetime of most Americans.
0	And we Americans have never shown a desire to fight there.
0	Assad has a vital interest: preservation of his family regime and the reunification of his country.
0	The Turks have a vital interest in keeping armed Kurds out of their border regions adjacent to their own Kurdish minority, which seeks greater independence.
0	The Israelis and Saudi royals want the U.S. to keep Iran from securing a land bridge from Tehran to Damascus to Lebanon.
0	The U.S. War Party wants us to smash Iran and remain in the Middle East forever to assure the hegemony of its favorites.
1	Have the generals taking us into Syria told the president how and when, if ever, they plan to get us out?

0	Nigel Farage Warns “We’ll Lose” A Battle Between the West and Islam
1	British politician Nigel Farage once helped convince Britons to vote for Brexit and separate from the European Union, but British establishment politicians have done everything they could to sabotage that vote since then.
1	Now Farage has apparently decided that if he can’t beat them, he’ll join them — if not on Brexit, then in their stance of denial and appeasement regarding the global jihad threat.’
1	At a recent dinner of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which he formerly headed, Farage said: “If dealing with Islamic fundamentalism becomes a battle between us and the entire religion, I’ll tell you the result: we’ll lose.
1	We will simply lose….We absolutely have to get that Muslim majority living in many of our towns and cities on our side, more attuned to Western values than some pretty hardline interpretations of the Qur’an.”
1	Sure.
0	Now how does Farage propose to do that?
1	His warning against making the resistance to jihad a “battle between us and the entire religion” is odd.
1	No sane person is saying that the West should go to war with the entire Islamic world.
1	The likeliest interpretation of his statement is that he is saying that we must not speak about how jihadis find justification for their actions in the Qur’an and Sunnah, as that will alienate the “moderates.”

1	But if we don’t speak about such facts, how will we ever convince Muslims not to follow “hardline interpretations of the Qur’an”?
1	Another problem with Farage’s statement is that it manifests a remarkable ignorance of history.
1	While he is deeply concerned that British people not begin to think that resisting jihad terror means that they are in a “battle” with the “entire religion” of Islam, he appears unaware of the fact that many Muslims throughout history have considered their entire religion to be at war with the entire non-Muslim world.
1	I document this abundantly in my new book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS .
1	To take one of innumerable examples, Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a fifteenth-century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane, observed that “the Qur’an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion.
1	Muhammad advises the same thing, according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors: wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels, as much to acquire that glory, as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests.”
1	After conquest came dhimmitude, the subjugated status that the Qur’an mandates for “the People of the Book” (primarily Jews and Christians).
0	In the early twelfth century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkamillah issued this edict:
1	Now, the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come—where it is their lot—is considered an act of piety; and the imposition of their poll tax [jizya], “until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled” (Koran 9:29) is a divinely ordained obligation….The dhimmi’s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim, or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated.
1	It must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him, so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low.
0	The jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full, without exception.
0	Underlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non-Muslims.
0	In the year 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces:
0	O you who believe!
1	The non-Muslims are nothing but dirt.
1	Allah has created them to be partisans of Satan; most treacherous in regard to all they do; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless, though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work.
0	Upon them rests the curse of Allah, of the Angels and of man collectively
1	We must not think that we are at war with the entire religion.
1	But what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the Muslims who consider themselves and their religion to be at war with us?
1	Nigel Farage has become just another mainstream hack politician.

1	Confirmed: Authorities LIED About Las Vegas Shooter’s Hotel Check-In Date – What Else Are They Hiding?
0	Over the last few days the alternative media has spent countless hours conducting their own investigations into what actually happened during the mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and over 500 injured.
1	From reports of multiple shooters to officials seemingly covering up the ISIS connection, many different theories have been put forth that counter the mainstream narrative.
1	Now, new information released by investigative reporter Laura Loomer proves that authorities have directly lied to the American people about the case at least once by claiming that supposed shooter Stephen Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Hotel on September 28th when valet records (with photos) prove he actually arrived three days earlier.
1	According to Loomer, she obtained the image from a source which shows that Paddock’s car first arrived September 25th.
1	The photo even has a handwritten note that was reportedly written by an FBI agent – proving that the FBI specifically lied to the country.
0	The picture “proves FBI misled public about #StephenPaddock’s check in date,” Loomer Tweeted.

0	Shockingly, another Tweet by Loomer also revealed that the license plate numbers given out by police after the horrific shooting DO NOT match the actual license plate of Paddock’s vehicle.
0	Law enforcement and @FBI misled the public about #Paddock‘s check in date and also provided public & media w/ wrong license plate number.
0	pic.twitter.com/y9hS6GqdKI — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) October 6, 2017
0	That’s right, photographic evidence from inside the hotel parking garage has confirmed that the FBI, along with state and local police, specifically lied about key details of the shooting.
1	This throws their entire narrative into question and makes one wonder what else is being hidden from the public?
0	Keep in mind that at least four videos from the scene of the shooting have already been released that indicate there were multiple shooters.
0	In fact, there are so many unanswered questions that the Drudge Report even linked to an article asking them directly.
1	As noted above, at this point literally every piece of so-called evidence put forth by authorities and then regurgitated by the mainstream media cannot be trusted and should be considered as disinformation until proven otherwise.
0	And if Paddock really did act alone and this evidence is some sort of mistake, there is surely video footage proving so.
0	Notice #StephenPaddock‘s van was last parked right next to a security camera inside “Garage East” @MandalayBay.
0	There is definitely footage.
0	https://t.co/L1caGn6uqw — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) October 6, 2017
0	It is also important to note that Paddock’s brother Eric has conducted a series of bizarre interviews that have led to even more questions about what actually happened in Las Vegas and what Paddock’s role was in the worst mass shooting in American history.
0	Viganò Doubles Down, Accuses Francis of Losing Sight of Christ
0	Archbishop Viganò has released a new, powerful statement necessitated by the peculiar reaction of Pope Francis to the Aug 22 Testimony.
1	Many thanks to our friends at LifeSiteNews, especially Diane Montagna, for the following translation and release of the follow-up testimony from arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today—Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò.
0	The former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down.
1	Far from backing-away and making excuses for his early actions, as we’ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks, Archbishop Viganò is digging in with a 4-page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse cover-up against Francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy, and even concludes with a suggestion that Francis is beginning to act as a “substitute of our Lord.”
0	Read the Archbishop’s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence.
1	This is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart—a modern-day Athanasius standing against something so much worse than Liberius.
0	Friends, let us pray for Archbishop Viganò.
1	He is standing alone now, and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history, but also the forces of hell itself—forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness.
1	Make no mistake about this: Archbishop Viganò is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church.
0	He is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls, for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself.
0	The enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the Apostles.
0	God help us.
1	It goes without saying that we here at The Remnant not only stand with Viganò but we thank God for him every day, we pray the Rosary for him every day, and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the Master he serves so well.
0	God bless you, Your Excellency, and Mary keep you.
0	We are with you!

0	As a priest and bishop of the holy Church, spouse of Christ, I am called like every baptized person to bear witness to the truth.
0	By the gift of the Spirit who sustains me with joy on the path that I am called to travel, I intend to do so until the end of my days.

0	*****
0	It has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.
1	My decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life.
1	I made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed.
1	The silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church.
0	Well aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true.
0	Christ died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ.
0	Certainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See.
0	But the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members.
1	I was a witness, not by my choice, of shocking facts and, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (par.
0	2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth.
0	Only the seal of confession could have justified my silence.
0	Neither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony.
0	“Qui tacet consentit” surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial.
1	How can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?
1	The center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions, and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken, the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church, in regard to the United States, the Curia, and even China, as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church.
1	Now, the pope’s reply to my testimony was: “I will not say a word!” But then, contradicting himself, he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate, and compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church — though without ever uttering my name.
0	If he had said: “Viganò lied,” he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own.
0	In so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth.
0	Instead, he put in place a subtle slander against me — slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder.
0	Indeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists.
0	When he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions.
1	But how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents?
1	The pope’s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building.
0	Moreover, the pope’s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake.
1	Many more instances have recently been documented in the press, showing that Pope Francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults.
0	These include his role in the case of Fr.
0	Julio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr.
0	Mauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O’Connor.
0	In the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick.
1	Cardinal DiNardo and the other prelates should tell the Church in America and in the world: did the pope refuse to carry out a Vatican investigation into McCarrick’s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up?
1	The faithful deserve to know.
0	I would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him.
0	He will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation.
0	At the beginning of Pope Francis’ pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Québec.
1	Later, however, when his work as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual “friends” of his dicastery, bypassing the Cardinal, he gave up.
1	His long article in L’Osservatore Romano, in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia, represents his surrender.
0	Your Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict’s sanctions on McCarrick.
0	You have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups.
0	Your Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth.
0	*****
1	Finally, I wish to encourage you, dear faithful, my brothers and sisters in Christ: never be despondent!
0	Make your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus, our Savior, of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy, Scio cui credidi, which I choose as my episcopal motto.
1	This is a time of repentance, of conversion, of prayers, of grace, to prepare the Church, the bride of the Lamb, ready to fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon.
1	Hungary PM Viktor Orban Vows to “Fight Those Who Want to Change the Christian Identity of Europe”
1	Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been somewhat of a lone voice in Europe against the Muslim invasion, and on Wednesday he gave a "Hungary First" speech in which he declared that he would "fight those who want to change the Christian Identity of Europe."
0	“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion," Orban said in a video statement on Facebook.
1	"For us, Hungary is first.
1	We will fight those who want to change the Christian identity of Hungary and Europe.”
0	Elnökségi ülés után Elnökségi ülés után // After the meeting of the presidency Posted by Orbán Viktor on Wednesday, February 7, 2018
1	Orban's words are reminiscent of those of US President Donald Trump, who spoke about putting "America First."
0	"The presidency of Fidesz has discussed yesterday the announcement of the Belgian Prime Minister, that they will – if necessary with force – obligate Central European countries, including Hungary, to accept migrants,” Orban stated.
0	“According to their plan, this will happen in June at the summit of the prime ministers in Brussels," he added.
0	“Our presidency has taken a stand: we cannot give in to extortion.
1	For us, Hungary is first."
1	“We will fight those who want to change the Christian identity of Hungary and Europe,” Orban concluded.
0	According to the Hungarian Government's website, posted about the ultimatum that was given over the weekend.
0	Over the weekend, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel spoke about sending “an ultimatum” to the Visegrád countries which “reject solidarity”.
0	The essence of this ultimatum would be that if by the end of June a consensus is not reached in the council of EU heads of government, then the planned reforms would be adopted with a qualified majority vote which would overrule dissenters.
1	Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó said on Tuesday,“Hungary will not become an immigrant country, it has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants."
1	He also referred to Michel's ultimatum as unacceptable and shocking.
1	“Hungary has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants, irrespective of whether there is any pressure in this direction along the borders or from Brussels,” Szijjártó said.
1	“The Belgian Prime Minister’s statement is also outrageous because this is the first time that people in Brussels are openly planning to push the mandatory resettlement quota through by force while totally ignoring the will of certain EU member states."
0	“We regard this whole thing as unacceptable and we reject it," he added.
0	“The countries of the Visegrád Group do not support the introduction of any kind of mandatory quota.”
1	“Perhaps it doesn’t bother the Belgian Prime Minister that there are no-go zones in many Western European cities, or that people with immigrant backgrounds have committed 27 major terrorist attacks in Europe recently, but this bothers the V4 because they do not want to live on a continent were the threat of terrorism becomes an everyday regularity," he continued.
0	Just this week, we reported that Hungary had grown weary of the talks of pushing illegal Muslim migrants on their country and Europe, and was preparing to walk away from the negotiating table.
0	Orban has taken a tough stance in Hungary.
1	He has ordered all illegal Muslim invaders to get out of Hungary and never come back.
0	In December, he said that he was not concerned with what Brussels wanted, but was determined to defend Hungary's borders.
0	PM Orban has done just that, too.
0	Orban's border wall virtually eliminated illegal immigration.
1	Orban is openly Christian and seems to understand something that many do not and that is you do not allow a wholesale flood of antichrists to pour into your country.
0	Were the Ammonites and Moabites not kept out of the assembly of Israel because of their hatred of the people of God?
0	(Deuteronoy 23:3-6) Yes, they were.
1	While Muslims need the Gospel for sure, one cannot allow such an influx into the country, or all you are asking for is the judgments God warned about in Deuteronomy 28.
1	I say, well done Mr. Orban.
0	I would like to hear more of that kind of talk from America's representatives.
0	Former Navy Sailor Pardoned By Trump To Sue Obama & Comey
0	Kristian Saucier, a former Navy sailor who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine he worked on but was later pardoned by President Donald Trump, says that he is going to pursue a lawsuit against several Obama administration members, including Former FBI Director James Comes and Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah.
0	The same FBI that gave Hillary Clinton a pass for operating an illegal email server, which we have evidence for the fact that she sent and received classified documents through resulting in a national security breach and at least one death, but would not give the same leniency to Saucier who simply took some pictures of his submarine.

0	His lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.
1	“They interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,” Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, “but they didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton.
0	Hillary is still walking free.
1	Two guys on my ship did the same thing and weren’t treated as criminals.
0	We want them to correct the wrong.” Daigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.
0	There is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.
0	“We’ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,” Daigle said.
0	“We’re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there’s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.”
0	Saucier's attorneys attempted to use the Hillary Clinton defense to get him out of hot water for taking pictures of classified systems aboard the USS Alexandria in 2009.
0	Prosecutors sloughed off the defense, saying it was essentially “grasping at highly imaginative and speculative straws in trying to further draw a comparison to the matter of Secretary Hillary Clinton based upon virtually no understanding and knowledge of the facts involved, the information at issue, not to mention any issues if intent and knowledge.”
0	Saucier confessed to taking photos of the submarine back in 2009 when he served as a 22-year-old machinist mate, saying he wanted to show the pictures to his family and future children.
0	Following an interview with the FBI in 2012, he destroyed all evidence of the pictures, meaning the Naval Criminal Investigative Service could not confirm his claims that he did not share the photos with unauthorized people.
1	“It was a foolish mistake by a very young man,” Saucier’s lawyer, Greg Rinckey, said.
1	“It’s a very sad case because Kristian Saucier is a fine young man.
0	We don’t believe this was really his true character.”
0	“My case was usually something handled by military courts,” Saucier said.
1	“They used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton,” he continued, alleging his life was ruined for political reasons.
0	President Trump had spoken of his support of Saucier on the campaign trail and blasted the Obama administration's handling of his case.
0	“With a pardon, there’s no magic wand that gets waved and makes everything right,” Saucier said, “But I try to stay positive and look forward.”
1	That's a good attitude considering he has had his cars repossessed and is in a tremendous amount of debt due to his incarceration and now having a felony on his record.
0	But hey, Hillary is free, right?
0	That's all that matters, cause after all, they're (Bill and Hillary) good people, aren't they, Mr. President?
1	I think it's great that Mr. Saucier has been pardoned, I really do, but I continue to ask what a lot of Americans continue to ask, why does the known criminal Hillary Clinton remain at large in our country with her corrupt foundation taking in billions, her trashing our Republic and continuing to have a national voice?
1	The American people weren't promised pardons, we were promised a special counsel to dig into the Clintons and bring about justice.
0	It's time that occurred.
0	London Borough With Highest Percentage Of Muslims In UK Votes To Ban Trump From Entering
1	I’m sure President Trump is deeply disappointed in not being able to enter Tower Hamlets.
1	But this ridiculous exercise in virtue-signaling, even though it has not (yet) been taken up by the Home Office, only highlights Britain’s hypocrisy and double standards regarding who can enter the country and who cannot.
1	Pamela Geller and I are banned from entering the country for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad.
1	Meanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.
0	Syed Muzaffar Shah Qadri’s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.
0	The UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: “If there’s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.
0	One – the easiest one maybe – chop their head off, that’s the easiest.
0	Second – burn them to death.
0	Third – throw ’em off a cliff.
0	Fourth – tear down a wall on them so they die under that.
0	Fifth – a combination of the above.”
1	Theresa May’s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws.
0	One of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
0	Meanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.
0	“London: Muslim Enclave Votes to ‘Ban Trump,’” by Liam Deacon, Breitbart, January 20, 2018:
1	A London borough – which has the highest percentage of Muslims in the UK – has voted to ban U.S. President Donald J. Trump for the area, declaring him a “bigot”.
0	The council has been at the centre of serious corruption scandals, including the removal of an Islamist mayor who was found guilty of bribing Muslim groups and wielding “undue spiritual influence” on Muslim voters.
0	The anti-Trump motion, proposed by Councillor Ohid Ahmed and Councillor Oliur Rahman, passed by a majority vote this week.
0	It calls for President Trump’s planned state visit to the United Kingdom to be cancelled, adding: “Should the Government still choose to go ahead with State Visit, this Council makes clear that President Trump would not be welcome in our Borough.” The area in East London includes the famous Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf, but the ban does not appear to be enforceable.
1	The current Labour mayor, John Biggs, complained that President Trump “doesn’t applaud diversity [and] doesn’t respect the culture of others and doesn’t respect women”.
0	The mayor added: “He is failing in his leadership and we should not welcome him here.
1	We must be vigorous in our intolerance of his intolerance.” In response to the news, Peter Golds, the leader of the Conservatives group in the council, tweeted: “In 2015 one of the Tower Hamlets First election candidates tweeted ‘let us support Hitler the Great.’ These people, corruptly elected, have no shame.
0	For the record, our group refused to vote in this farce.” “Tower Hamlets is home to one of the country’s most diverse communities,” the motion begins, adding that it “has the highest percentage of Muslim residents in England – 35 per cent compared with the national average of 5 per cent”.
1	After several paragraphs of platitudes about “community cohesion” and “diversity”, it says “this Council notes with shock and alarm the decision by Donald Trump, President of the United States, to ‘retweet’ Islamophobic propaganda from the Britain First Twitter account”.
1	It also bemoans that he has allegedly “bigoted attitude towards women, ethnic minorities and Muslims which has resulted in examples of division and hatred within the USA and beyond” and attacks his “illogical” decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
1	The motion also notes that the neighbouring Royal Borough of Greenwich formally adopted a similar motion in December last year….

0	A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?
0	The meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] .
0	The reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, “religious assistant” priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations.
1	Given that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.
0	Today I’ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the “Federations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land” in Avila, February 2009.
1	As a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely “federated,” it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what “federations” are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.
0	Reconciled to managed extinction
0	The report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, “infirmary Carmels,” nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.
0	Solutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by “religious psychologists,” ever more powers handed to federations.
0	This is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis’ New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.
0	Very little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.
1	And perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order’s most desperate hour.
1	Nothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites’ traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of “the path taken”.
0	Indeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.
0	The report from Great Britain notes: “18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.
0	There have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.
0	Two communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.”
1	The case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down.
0	Only one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.
0	But in this situation, the “solution” undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for “a completely new structure,” whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.
0	The atmosphere is weirdly resigned – one federation report recommended simply “forgetting the numbers” – with many notes of mutual congratulation over “unity,” the creating of “links” and the “building of trust” and “dialogue” between communities.
0	The report from Belgium – federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries – states tersely that their biggest problem is “ageing” but under “possible solutions” says only, “We want to continue along the path we have begun.”
0	It is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].
0	It is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.
0	Federation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.
0	This outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.
0	But the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: “Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.”
0	Path taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.
0	From the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.
0	Each year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association.
0	The duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.
0	We invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.
0	Present Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries.
0	Nowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.
0	Possible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.
0	These self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.
0	All speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared “formation courses,” meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally “care homes” and houses given over entirely as infirmaries.

0	The strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create “a completely new structure,” complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:
0	Federation: Netherlands
0	Date when erected: 1971
0	Number of convents: 6
0	Number of nuns: 73
0	Solemnly professed: 73
0	In formation: ....
0	Average age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]
0	What has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.
0	This has created a close communion from the beginning.
0	Everyone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.
0	Present Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.
0	4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.
0	Another Carmel was renewed in 1990.
0	At the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.
0	With the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.
0	Also, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.
0	Finally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.
0	Due to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.
0	We are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.
0	The structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.
0	Possible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.
0	We began from three points:
0	1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.
0	2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.
0	The team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.
0	3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.
0	This council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.
0	In October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.
0	They had meetings with Fr.
0	General and with the Congregation for Religious.
0	These were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.
0	An important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.
0	We were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.
0	It is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.
0	Definitive permission came at the 25th of February.
0	~~~
1	Given this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.
0	Sr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican’s Congregation for Religious told them that the “two great challenges to our contemplative life” are “the challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.” She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.
0	Cor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:
0	The nuns were exhorted to “stay awake to welcome the dawn” of a bright new future:
0	“These are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.” “Our aim must be to be open to the future.
0	We should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.
0	It is a wide road that opens up before us.
0	We must be women of hope and faith.
0	We must always believe that God is the one who directs history.
0	From this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).” [emphasis in the original.]
1	While there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.
0	Instead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the “problems and difficulties that we can encounter” in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including “consumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.”
1	What are these people smoking?
0	Given that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this “new dawn” was actually about.
1	Perhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, “A ‘new dawn’ of what, exactly?” This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.
0	Was Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?
0	It is certainly clear from Francis’ first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.
0	His first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation’s Secretary and – given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them – the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.
1	The first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.
0	Certainly this record of the European Carmelites’ meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.
0	On the final day of the meeting, the “theme for the day” was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: “Government: the need for change.
0	Autonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.
0	General; other solutions to government.”
0	The devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone’s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: “Essential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,” the Father General warned.
0	And there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.
0	A common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to “ask questions” rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:
0	“Who discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?
0	“Are there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?
0	“At the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.
0	Stability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?
0	“The valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.
0	Can such essential autonomy continue as it is?
0	“50 years ago there was stability.
0	How do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.
0	General?
0	“Could there be other forms of government?”
0	Following the Father General’s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:
0	“While some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of ‘external’ interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.
0	Though we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.” “...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when… the same person remains prioress for years.” “...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.
0	We perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.
0	We do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.” “...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.”
0	Maybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the “progressivist” faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.
0	What comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican’s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.
0	And with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.
1	So many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the “conservatives” John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was “onside.” At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries.
0	But this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.
0	_____________________
0	[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.
0	“Eucharist and Lauds in Spanish.
0	Fr.
0	Isidore D’Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.
0	Each psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group.
0	However, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages.
0	The end result was that we could all join in the liturgy.
0	We were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.”
0	[2] Solution: new foundations, the spreading of the Carmelite charism into new territories.

0	FBI Can’t Find Motive of Muslim Who Drove Burning Minivan Onto Travis Air Force Base
0	“Motive a mystery in car explosion at Travis Air Force Base” was the Los Angeles Times headline, and this one is indeed a real mystery.
0	A Muslim named Hafiz Kazi, according to the Times, “drove a burning minivan filled with propane and gas tanks into the front gate of Travis Air Force Base in Northern California.” After scrutinizing all the evidence closely, the FBI just can’t figure out what could possibly have been Kazi’s motive.
0	And that in a nutshell shows what’s wrong with today’s FBI.
0	Sean Ragan, FBI special agent in charge of the Sacramento field office, stated: “We don’t have any nexus of terrorism at this point.
0	Now the question is, why.
0	Why was he there?
0	What led him there?
0	And we don’t know answers to that, quite frankly.”
0	The Times noted that when emergency responders approached the burning van after it crashed, “they found five propane tanks, three plastic one-gallon gas cans, several lighters, three phones and a gym bag with personal items, Ragan said.”
0	Yes, what Kazi could possibly have been up to is a complete mystery.
0	The Times added that “the dead man’s religious beliefs and affiliation are not known at this point, said Ragan, who debunked a rumor that some sort of ‘jihad’ video was found on Kazi’s phone.”
0	All right.
0	No jihad video.
0	And no “nexus of terrorism,” according to Sean Ragan.
0	What is a nexus of terrorism?
0	Ragan most likely means that investigators didn’t find an ISIS membership card in Kazi’s wallet, or lots of phone calls to Iraq or Syria, or a note from Kazi reading, “I did this for Allah and Islam.
1	Allahu akbar.”
0	Of course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI’s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi’s motive.
0	In any case, a larger point is being lost here.
0	And that is that there is a war going on.
1	We know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians.
0	We know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself.
0	Even if he wasn’t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.
0	The FBI’s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption.
0	The FBI doesn’t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism.
0	It doesn’t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event, unrelated to all the others.
1	So each time something like this happens, they’re back at Square One, trying to figure out motive.
1	It’s as if the U.S. Army stopped to interrogate every German soldier who crashed through the Ardennes Forest at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, to see if each one’s actions had anything to do with the German Army and Adolf Hitler’s war aims.
0	Authorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues.
1	Here again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming “Allahu akbar.” Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command.
1	This willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic.
0	How long is this comic opera going to continue?
1	If the jihadis advance even into the FBI’s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis’ motive even as the machete begins to slice through their necks?

1	“We Now Have Urban Ebola” In Congo, WHO Warns Of “Potentially Explosive Increase” In Cases
0	This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
1	Experts fear an “explosive increase” in Ebola cases after an outbreak in Congo entered a “new phase” and spread from the countryside to a city.
0	The BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people about 130km (80 miles) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month.
0	The city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa.
0	Forty-four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died.
1	Senior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an “explosive increase” in cases.
0	“This is a major development in the outbreak,” he told the BBC.
0	“We have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola.
1	The potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.” Mr Salama, the WHO’s deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said Mbandaka’s location on the Congo river, widely used for transportation, raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people.
0	“This puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,” he said.
0	The BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally.
0	But Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures.
0	“The good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,” he added.
0	“They know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals.
0	They know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak.”
0	As The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s.
0	Ebola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.
0	The Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo’s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said.
0	Supplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities.
0	The vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease, as well as health workers.
0	The vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C, tricky in a country with unreliable electricity.
0	Congressman: "Credible Evidence" Of “Terrorist Infiltration Through the Southern Border” Related To Las Vegas Shooting
0	We have had the Islamic State claim over and over that they were taking credit for the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017, and that Stephen Paddock was a recent convert to Islam.
1	Now, a congressman is saying there is "credible evidence" of "terrorist infiltration through the southern border" that is related to the Las Vegas shooting.
0	If you recall, the Islamic State has never claimed responsibility for attacks they were not involved in.
0	Here are just a few of those claims.
0	In Naba 100 #ISIS featured an infographic on #LasVegas attack & indicated the shooter, "Abu Abdul Barr al-Amriki," converted 6 months ago pic.twitter.com/5JhMFbU2Se — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) October 5, 2017
0	On Thursday evening, Representative Scott Perry (R-PA) appeared on Tucker Carlson tonight and said that he has evidence that the Islamic State may be telling the truth and that they may actually have been involved in the deadly attack.
0	Perry brought up the fact that we can't seem to get information in the case that the public needs to be made aware of, something that was brought up in a district courtroom earlier this week.
0	Additionally, the family of Stephen Paddock just received his cremated remains on Thursday and his brother said that the family has yet to receive an autopsy report.
0	Why is that?
0	Everyone who was killed that night had autopsies and those have been released.
0	We're told Paddock shot himself in the head, right?
1	Why would the autopsy report be something that needs to be withheld from the public or his family?
1	"Recently I’ve been made aware of what I believe to be credible evidence regarding potential terrorist infiltration through the southern border regarding this incident," Perry said.
0	"Twice before the attack, ISIS warned the United States they would attack Las Vegas," he added.
0	"In June and August."
0	"And then after the attack claimed responsibility four times," Perry continued.
1	"Something’s not adding up."
0	"I’m just telling you I have received what I feel to be and believe to be credible evidence of a possible terrorist nexus," Perry said.
0	The investigation has been conducted by local and state police, not the feds, and yet, they continue to claim there is not Islamic terrorist involvement.
0	Yet, though they claim that Paddock was a lone gunman, they continue to withhold video of him in Mandalay Bay because they are still investigating other suspects to charge in the shooting.
0	And no one seems to know where alleged Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos is either.
0	None of this is really that surprising.
0	If you recall, we reported on Islamic terrorists settling into Mexico and crossing the border some years back and that came out as the infamous "Gang of Eight" were working on an immigration deal and had rejected building the 700 miles of double-tier border fencing Congress authorized just seven years ago, with a majority of the Senate saying they didn't want to delay granting illegal immigrants legal status while the fence was being built.
0	Three years prior to that report, there was a video report that seems to have provided a bit of evidence to the claim that Islamists were crossing our southern border.
1	And even though Islamic jihadis have been apprehended on our border in 2014, the Homeland Security waved their hand and said, "There's no threat."
0	In fact, DHS had denied Muslim terrorists were crossing the border, but a local investigator produced evidence to the contrary.
0	Reports indicated that some jihadis were paying as much as $50,000 to get across the border.
0	This has been documented for several years now.
0	It's not surprising.
1	What is surprising is the level of secrecy surrounding the Las Vegas shooting and the containment of information more than three months after it occurred.
1	New Virus With NO CURE Spreading: This Is WORSE Than The ‘Black Death’
0	A new virus for which medical officials have no remedy is spreading.
1	The infectious disease also has a fatality rate of almost 90% making it much more deadly than the black death plaguing Madagascar.
0	A deadly outbreak of a rare and highly fatal virus has broken out in eastern Uganda and five cases have already been identified, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed.
0	The disease is known as the Marburg virus.
0	It is similar to the Ebola virus and can be fatal in up to 88% of cases.
0	The outbreak of the contagious and deadly Marburg virus disease in the Kween district of eastern Uganda was declared by the nation’s Ministry of Health back on October 19.
0	Since then, five cases have been identified as international aid agencies, stretched thin by Madagascar’s black death outbreak, have rushed to deploy teams on the ground to control the recent outbreak.
1	This news comes amid a surge in cases of plague in Madagascar, which is considered to be the “worst outbreak in 50 years” and now at “crisis” point.
0	Marburg virus disease (MVD), which causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever, ranks among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans, according to the World Health Organization.
1	The WHO website reads: “Marburg virus disease is a rare disease with a high mortality rate for which there is no specific treatment.
0	The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g.
0	monkeys and fruit bats).” MVD also falls within the same family as the Ebola virus – the hemorrhagic fever that decimated West Africa and killed around 11,000 in 2014 and 2015.
0	The outbreak is thought to have begun in September when a man in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats, was admitted to a local health center with a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.
0	The man’s condition deteriorated quickly and he failed to respond to antimalarial treatments.
0	He died after being taken to another hospital, and a short time later, his sister in her 50’s also died of the same ailment.
0	Emergency screening has begun at the Kenya-Uganda border in Turkana after all three members of the same family died of the disease in Uganda.
1	Health workers have been asked to work with communities to stop the deadly Marburg outbreak from devastating communities in the rural region.
1	Dr. Zabulon Yoti, a Technical Coordinator for Emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa, said: “Community engagement is the cornerstone of emergency response.” He urged health officials to “work with the communities to build their capacity for success and sustainability” and develop a better understanding of the local customs and traditions.
0	Early symptoms include fever, chills, headache, and myalgia (muscle pain).

1	“Many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam.”
0	Yes, and not just ex-Muslims.
1	It has become a superdogma in the Catholic Church: if you don’t believe that Islam is a Religion of Peace, you will be ruthlessly harassed and silenced by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the hierarchy elsewhere as well.
1	The bishops of the Catholic Church are much more concerned that you believe that Islam is a religion of peace than that you believe in, say, the Nicene Creed.
0	And the Pope is almost certain to ignore this heartfelt appeal, as he has ignored others who have respectfully questioned his departures from Catholic teaching.
0	I have yet to meet a Catholic prelate who believes that the requirement to treat all charitably applies to those who hold opinions that have been deemed unacceptable.
0	“Leave them; they are blind guides.
0	And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” (Matthew 15:14)
0	“Islamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,” by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018:
0	A new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far.
0	“Most Holy Father,” it begins, “‬Many of us ‬have tried to contact you, ‬on many occasions ‬and for several years, ‬and we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.”
0	The letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is “a good religion in itself” as the pope “seems to teach”?
0	It’s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church.
0	The signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:
1	You do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet).
1	If Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic?
0	Do not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives?
0	Islam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know?
0	How is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence?
0	“What is the relationship between Christ and Satan?
0	What union is there between light and darkness?
0	What association between the faithful and the unfaithful?” (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life.
0	Are we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?
0	The letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:
0	In fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything.
1	As a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: “Between us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!” (Qur’an 60.4) For the Qur’an, Christians “are only impurity” (Quran 9.28),” “the worst of Creation” (Qur’an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur’an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30).
0	We must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5).
1	Where the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus’ death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the “infidels” in exchange for his paradise: “They fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.” (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you “dialogue” means the voice of peace, for Islam it’s only another way to make war.
0	Also, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naiveté in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous.
0	How can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: “To wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (…) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran.
0	“(Rome, January 20, 2014)?
0	That the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry?
0	Should we return to Islam?
1	The authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle “against the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world” because “they share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).” They contest the idea that speaking in an “Islamophilic tone” will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that “apart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).”
1	The letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who “do not welcome any refugee” while Pope Francis preaches
0	the welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: “If anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him.
0	Whoever greets him participates in his evil works.” (2 John 1.10-11); “If anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!” (Galatians 1.8-9)
1	The signatories go on to give voice to the utter scandal of the pope’s failure to carry out his evangelical mission as the Vicar of Christ to call home the members of the Islamic faith:
1	The pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam … Thus ignorant souls are misled…
0	Taking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope’s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians
0	not preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No.
0	57).
1	We are under the impression that you do not take your brother Bishop Nona Amel, Chaldean-Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in exile, seriously, when he tells us: “Our present sufferings are the prelude to those that you, Europeans and Western Christians, will suffer in the near future.
0	I have lost my diocese.
1	The headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die.
0	(…) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims.
0	You are in danger as well.
0	You must make strong and courageous decisions (…).
0	You think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal.
0	(…) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.” (August 9, 2014) “.
1	This is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous.
0	We do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it.
0	Where then would we go to seek refuge?
0	The signatories plea is that the pope will “quickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.”
0	DOJ Surrenders: 3D Print Gun Files Are Protected Under First Amendment
1	For those who remember Cody Wilson, the man who began developing 3D printing files so that you could manufacture your own guns, there is good news out.
1	Cody finally won against the federal beast after intimidation tactics were performed against him by the Obama Justice Department.
0	The Trump DOJ settled with Wilson, finally acknowledging that his 3D print gun files are protected as free speech under the First Amendment.
0	I first reported that 3-D guns were for real back in July of 2012, when an internet gunsmith by the name of "Have Blue" produced an AR style pistol that fired both .22 and .223 caliber bullets.
0	Later, Cody Wilson, 25, a law student at the University of Texas and founder of the non-profit group Defense Distributed, had produced a 3-D printed handgun made entirely of ABS plastic with only a metal firing pin.

0	In 2013, Wilson had the information on how to build the gun removed from public access at the request of the United States Department of Defense Trade Controls.
0	According to Wilson, they seized control of the information.
1	Clearly, they were acting unlawfully when they did what they did.
1	"I thought my life was over," Wilson said after his attorneys told him he didn't fair well going up against the government.
0	So, what did he do?
0	He fired them, and got a new legal team.
0	Wired has the story.
1	Instead, Wilson has spent the last years on an unlikely project for an anarchist: Not simply defying or skirting the law but taking it to court and changing it.
0	In doing so, he has now not only defeated a legal threat to his own highly controversial gunsmithing project.
1	He may have also unlocked a new era of digital DIY gunmaking that further undermines gun control across the United States and the world—another step toward Wilson's imagined future where anyone can make a deadly weapon at home with no government oversight.
0	Two months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government.
0	Wilson and his team of lawyers focused their legal argument on a free speech claim: They pointed out that by forbidding Wilson from posting his 3-D-printable data, the State Department was not only violating his right to bear arms but his right to freely share information.
0	By blurring the line between a gun and a digital file, Wilson had also successfully blurred the lines between the Second Amendment and the First.
0	"If code is speech, the constitutional contradictions are evident," Wilson explained to WIRED when he first launched the lawsuit in 2015.
1	"So what if this code is a gun?” The Department of Justice's surprising settlement, confirmed in court documents earlier this month, essentially surrenders to that argument.
0	It promises to change the export control rules surrounding any firearm below .50 caliber—with a few exceptions like fully automatic weapons and rare gun designs that use caseless ammunition—and move their regulation to the Commerce Department, which won't try to police technical data about the guns posted on the public internet.
0	In the meantime, it gives Wilson a unique license to publish data about those weapons anywhere he chooses.
0	"I consider it a truly grand thing," Wilson says.
1	"It will be an irrevocable part of political life that guns are downloadable, and we helped to do that."
0	The Second Amendment Foundation has issued the following press release:
0	BELLEVUE, WA – The Department of Justice and Second Amendment Foundation have reached a settlement in SAF’s lawsuit on behalf of Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed over free speech issues related to 3-D files and other information that may be used to manufacture lawful firearms.
1	SAF and Defense Distributed had filed suit against the State Department under the Obama administration, challenging a May 2013 attempt to control public speech as an export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a Cold War-era law intended to control exports of military articles.
0	Under terms of the settlement, the government has agreed to waive its prior restraint against the plaintiffs, allowing them to freely publish the 3-D files and other information at issue.
0	The government has also agreed to pay a significant portion of the plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees, and to return $10,000 in State Department registration dues paid by Defense Distributed as a result of the prior restraint.
0	Significantly, the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military.
1	“Not only is this a First Amendment victory for free speech, it also is a devastating blow to the gun prohibition lobby,” noted SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb.
0	“For years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called ‘weapons of war,’ and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.
0	“Under this settlement,” he continued, “the government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.
0	They will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.
0	That will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.” The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation’s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing and legal action group focusing on the Constitutional right and heritage to privately own and possess firearms.
0	Founded in 1974, The Foundation has grown to more than 600,000 members and supporters and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.
0	What does all this mean?
1	Well, it's pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation.
0	Why?
0	Because now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.
0	That's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so.
0	And we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.
0	We're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.
0	This actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.
1	Wilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control.
1	"I barely put a million bucks into this and I got you the Second Amendment forever," he told The Daily Wire in a phone interview.
1	"What has the NRA done for you lately?"
0	I don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that "the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber – including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms – are not inherently military."
0	Therefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.
0	"This doesn’t put the rifle in everyone’s hand, but it does that in essence" he added.
0	"The DNA of our culture is preserved.
0	This is the first pillar in the internet gun culture of tomorrow, and it is permanent."
1	This is a huge milestone in the history of our county, and as such, it should be celebrated as a victory.

1	Black Death: ‘It’s 100 % Likely’ It Spreads To The UK And A ‘Ticking Time Bomb’ Ready To Decimate The World
0	The death toll in Madagascar due to the plague has jumped for the first time since health officials claimed the infection was in the beginning stages of control.
0	With the new uptick in those who died, the fear that the disease will spread to the United Kingdom has been confirmed as “100 percent likely.”
0	The plague death toll has now shown signs that it’s picking up speed again.
1	Official figures reveal 165 people have now lost their lives in Madagascar’s “worst outbreak in 50 years.” Recent data shows a 15 percent jump in fatalities over just three days, coupled with scientists concerned that the black death has reached a “crisis” point.
1	Ten other African countries have also been placed on high alert, warning that an outbreak could occur at any time.
0	At least 2,034 people have been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics.
1	Some experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year’s outbreak – which is expected to blight Madagascar until April.
1	Others worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain.
0	The plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours.
1	That would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics.
0	According to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country.
0	This form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year.
1	The bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the “Black Death” in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people.
0	But with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren’t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.
0	Paul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea.
0	He previously said: “The big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it’s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control.
1	If we don’t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.” There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added.
0	“We don’t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control.
0	We are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.” But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur.
0	Hopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.
1	A few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region.
1	Richard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities.
1	Conway is saying it’s “only a matter of time” before the disease arrives on British soil.
1	Conroy warned it is inevitable that the plague will spread due to the vast movement of people across the globe.
1	“I believe that it’s 100 percent likely that plague will arrive in the UK once more – it’s just a question of ‘when’, not ‘if’.
1	And it’s not an exaggeration to say that this is a real threat – a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to decimate the world,” Conroy continued.
0	“With the current outbreak still remaining treatable with antibiotics, however, the current risk is low.”
0	Ebola Outbreak Confirmed in Democratic Republic of Congo
1	On Tuesday, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo announced an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, a deadly virus that causes severe bleeding and organ failure, among other unpleasant symptoms.
0	The declaration was made after two cases of the diseases were confirmed in the Bikoro province in the northwestern part of the country ten months after the end of an earlier outbreak.
0	© AP Photo / Abbas Dulleh Ebola-Like Marburg Virus Kills Two People in Uganda
0	According to the country's Health Ministry, five samples were taken from suspected cases in Bikoro.
0	Out of the five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, two tested positive for Ebola.
0	However, no deaths have been reported among those with the disease.
0	"We will gather more samples, conduct contact tracing, engage the communities with messages on prevention and control and put in place methods for improving data collection and sharing," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's (WHO) regional director for Africa, following the outbreak announcement.
0	"WHO will work closely with health authorities and partners to support the national response," Moeti added.
0	This is the Congo's ninth outbreak of the virus since it was discovered in the country in 1976.
0	The last outbreak occurred in the northern Bas Uele province in 2017.
0	However, it was quickly contained due to swift action taken by the government and the WHO.
0	New Las Vegas Shooter Theory: “Rushed And Unprepared… Could Have Led To Accident Like Shooting Himself In The Head”
0	It should be clear by now that the entire official narrative surrounding the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 people dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.
0	From shooter Paddock’s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.
0	In the last 24 hours the Sheriff’s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.
0	Originally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.
0	As it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.
1	As part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.
0	The security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.
0	Paddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.
0	Paddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.
0	Police officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.
0	And Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.
0	What’s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.
0	The hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw “multiple gunmen.” The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre
0	As of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:
0	The new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:
1	What happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren’t the police rushing to the scene immediately?
0	Why did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?
0	Paddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.
0	Police didn’t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped – which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.
0	Moreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?
0	Or is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?
0	According to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:
0	Latest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don’t know why he stopped shooting.

0	(@New_England_) October 10, 2017
1	While we may never know the exact circumstances surrounding what transpired in the shooter’s hotel room, the information being released not just by law enforcement, but witnesses to the event who recorded hundreds of cumulative hours of video and audio, now calls the entirety official story into question.
1	CNN's Don Lemon Contradicts Himself In Just One Sentence: "We Have to Stop Demonizing People ... White Men, Most Of Them Radicalized"

0	However, it comes as no surprise from a hypocrite who works for a hypocritical, lying, fake news outlet like CNN.
0	Don Lemon wanted to defend the "peaceful" migrants who are headed toward the US border to illegally enter the country against our immigration laws, but said that the "biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the right."
1	How can he contradict himself like that and not even bat an eyelid?
1	In discussing the arrival of these migrants who obviously gotten incredible help along the way, busted through customs gates, and pushed at the Mexican border while committing all sorts of crimes against many they come in contact with along the way, Lemon said what is clearly not only racist but utterly insane.

0	'Textbook Definition of Bias'
0	On Monday, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified with FBI boss Christopher Wray before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
0	In a predictable performance, the duo cited mistakes and raised concerns but solved none of the lingering mysteries the massive report released last week that found anti-Trump bias did not affect FBI and DOJ decisions.
0	On Tuesday Horowitz performed solo before a joint session of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees.
0	Oversight chairman Trey Gowdy delivered the opening statement.
0	The attorney general had been accused of “softening or watering down his report,” Gowdy said, “When the reality is it was Jim Comey who softened and watered down his press release, announcing no charges against Secretary Clinton.
1	We see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding which DOJ policies to follow and which to ignore, to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to support each and every element of an offense and we see Jim Comey and Jim Comey alone deciding whether to send a letter to Congress in the throes of looming election.”
1	In a devastating exchange with Horowitz, Gowdy said that “prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it ends, and prejudging the outcome of an investigation before it begins” is the “textbook definition of bias.” Democrats echoed the IG report’s conclusion that there was no bias.
0	Republicans sought to tie up some loose threads.
0	The IG report confirmed that President Obama communicated with Hillary Clinton on her unsecured email system.
0	Horowitz said the president had been one of 13 who had done so.
0	Rep. Steve King asked about the volume of communications between the president and Clinton.
0	“I’ll have to get back to you on that,” Horowitz said, and the IG was “not sure” if any of the communications had involved classified or top secret material.
0	If the IG did know the subject of the president’s communications with Clinton, he failed to reveal any details.
0	Horowitz “would have to ask” if his team interviewed any officials at the Obama White House but said “not the president himself.”
1	Rep. King asked Horowitz about his first encounter with the switch of “extremely careless” for ‘gross negligence,” which violated a criminal statute.
0	Horowitz found that Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and James Comey were all involved.
1	The IG also said his team focused on the fact that the classified material on Clinton’s server was “not clearly marked,” which repeated one of Clinton’s claims about her negligence.
0	As for the question of her “intent,” Horowitz said it arose “months earlier,” maybe in 2015, though he couldn’t be sure.
0	King said President Obama had suggested the “careless but not intentional” language in a “60 Minutes” appearance in October of 2015.
0	And King had observed that in his July 5, 2016 statement, James Comey used “intent” six times.
0	Horowitz said Comey “concealed from the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, his intention to make a unilateral announcement in July 2016 about the reasons for his recommendations not to prosecute former Secretary Clinton.” The IG also described his report as a “thorough, comprehensive and objective recitation of the facts.”
0	The IG did confirm that Peter Strzok and Lisa Page worked on the Clinton investigation, the Russia and the Mueller team.
0	Horowitz said Strzok and Page had exchanged “tens of thousands of texts.” Ohio Rep. James Jordan asked Horowitz when his team had discovered the message about “we’ll stop” Trump.
0	Horowitz conceded that this meant “stop Trump from becoming president.” The IG said they uncovered that text in May, and Jordan asked “why did we not see it until last Thursday?”
0	“I can’t answer that,” Horowitz said, adding that it had been sent to Rod Rosenstein’s department at the DOJ.
0	Jordan concluded that Rosenstein “made the decision that we had to wait a month.”
0	Several representatives were curious about two FBI agents and one lawyer the IG report had not named.
0	“The FBI raised a concern because they work on counterintelligence matters,” Horowitz said.
0	Rep Mark Meadows asked if the two FBI agents were Kevin Clinesmith and Sally Moyer, which the IG declined to confirm.
0	“They don’t work in counterintelligence,” said Meadows, who charged that the FBI gave the IG “false information” and altered key witness reports.
0	“How did Comey see the report before it came out?” Rep. Darrell Issa wanted to know.
0	Horowitz said Comey didn’t see the whole thing, but explained that he allowed those the IG team had criticized to have a look before release.
0	By the end of the day it was evident that Congress would have to hear from Comey, Rosenstein, Strzok and others.
0	Horowitz confirmed that the IG is investigating whether FBI official Peter Strzok’s anti-Trump bias factored into the launch of the bureau’s Russia probe.
0	Also on Tuesday Peter Strzok was “escorted” from the FBI building.
0	As his lawyer told reporters, Strzok had “played by the rules,” but been targeted by “unfounded personal attacks, political games and inappropriate information leaks.”
0	“I hope he comes and portrays himself as a victim,” Trey Gowdy told Fox News.
0	Rep. Bob Goodlatte said the committee would issue a subpoena for Strzok to testify “next week.”
1	That will make for an exciting show on C-SPAN but none of this would be happening if the deep state plot to “stop” Trump had succeeded.
0	Desperate Feinstein Pushes 30-Year-Old Claim About Sexual Misconduct Of Kavanaugh
1	It's incredible the amount of hypocrisy Senator Dianne Feinstein puts on display for the American people to see, and yet, the people in her state continue to put her in office.
1	Her latest antics are to point to a more than 30 year old claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while he was in high school and somehow claim that he may have committed a crime while at the same time remaining silent on two women who have accused Rep. Keith Ellison, who is running for Attorney General in Minnesota, of abusing them, one of them making the claim this year.
0	“I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,” Senator Feinstein said in a surprise statement.
0	“That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision.
0	I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.”
1	Of course, the reality is that bringing something like this up more than 30 years later is ridiculous, but this is the Democrats for you.

0	Fox News reports:
0	A spokesperson for Feinstein declined Fox News’ request to elaborate on the lawmaker’s statement, but there has been much speculation that she is referring to a secret letter that has been the subject of intrigue on Capitol Hill over the last few days.
0	A source familiar with the confirmation proceedings told Fox News that Feinstein received the letter back in July, but did not make its existence known publicly until Thursday.
0	According to a report by The Intercept, the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University and concerns an incident involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.
0	According to two officials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times, the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Kavanaugh and the woman.
0	The letter reportedly was given to Feinstein by Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., but has not been publicly disclosed by senators who have seen the document.
0	Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said that the letter in question has been referred to the FBI for investigation.
0	The FBI conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees.
0	“Upon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaugh’s background file, as per the standard process,” the FBI said in a statement.
1	The White House has called this nothing more than a last minute gambit, and that would be correct.
0	In fact, the FBI has no plans to pursue any investigation regarding the allegation.
0	According to The Washington Post:
0	According to a person familiar with the matter, the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter, which would normally be handled by local authorities, if it was within the statute of limitations.
0	The FBI instead passed the material to the White House, as an update to Kavanaugh's background check, which already had been completed, the person said.
0	The move is similar to what the bureau did when allegations were leveled against former White House aide Rob Porter.
0	... Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed the controversy on Twitter.
0	“Let me get this straight: this is [a] statement about [a] secret letter regarding a secret matter and an unidentified person.
0	Right,” he tweeted sarcastically.
0	“I will add: the FBI already performed and has reported on a background investigation on the nominee and thhttp://ericposner.com/is-brett-kavanaugh-an-originalist/is has been made available to all Senators on the Judiciary Committee,” Cornyn wrote.
0	Exactly!
1	This is political theater over a man who is not an originalist and not a strict Constitutionalist.
1	He's a precedence man!
0	He's said it over and over!
1	If they wanted something on the guy, why don't they bring up his involvement in the Vince Foster cover-up?
1	Now, that would be something to really look into, but not with the corrupt DOJ and FBI we currently have.
1	Of course, if they did, then someone might actually have to act on something that actually was a crime.
0	SO MUCH FOR MERCY & DIALOGUE: Member of Vatican International Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue
0	The Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB’s decision to sack Fr.
0	Thomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office.
1	It took a matter of hours for the brave defenders of the status quo to leap into action against the mild Franciscan friar’s polite plea to Pope Francis to defend the Catholic Faith and faithful.
0	Or at least to stop attacking them.
0	In a letter made public November 1st, Fr.
0	Weinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops’ Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican’s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused “chronic confusion” among the faithful and bishops.
1	He wrote to the pope, “To teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.” He added that Catholics are “disconcerted” by the appointment of bishops “who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief, but who support and even defend them.”
0	In an interview yesterday with John Allen’s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, “I don’t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops.
0	Neither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.”
1	“Bishops are quick learners,” he wrote in his letter, “and what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it,” claiming that many bishops don’t speak out publicly for fear they will be “marginalized or worse.”
0	And sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr.
1	Weinandy had been given the boot.
0	Of course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.
1	Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops – as with nearly all the episcopate – are to what political analysts call the “optics”.
0	Political consultants often ask: how does it look?
1	And it looks extremely bad.
0	As though the fog of irony weren’t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis’ cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account.
0	Which, it must be said, only proves Fr.
0	Weinandy’s point once again.
0	Some of the criticism has been unusually sharp.
0	Fr.
1	Hunwicke wrote this afternoon, “This cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope] F[rancis] is presiding over a bully-boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes.
0	Just as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.”
1	As I write this, the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down, and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics – even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists – have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies.
0	In his letter, Fr.
0	Weinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis’ agenda.
0	In fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,
0	“I see that Fr.
0	Thomas Weinandy has been squashed.
0	He was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet.
0	To me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.
0	He is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching.
0	I would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience.
0	I imagine that it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.”
0	When I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK’s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, “This is absolutely right.
0	Not a man to seek out confrontation.”
0	The Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.
0	Weinandy’s concerns.
0	He said the pope is…
0	Fostering “chronic confusion.”
0	“Demeaning” the importance of doctrine.
1	Appointing bishops who “scandalize” believers with dubious “teaching and pastoral practice.”
1	Giving prelates who object the impression they’ll be “marginalized or worse” if they speak out.
1	Causing faithful Catholics to “lose confidence in their supreme shepherd.”
0	Our friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.
0	Fr.
0	Weinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.
0	Like the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.
0	Notable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people.
0	The pope, he said, seems “to censor and even mock” critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a “kind of calumny…alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.”
0	In an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but “more concerned about the good that my letter might do.” The letter “expresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who’ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions.
0	I wanted them to know that I listened.”
1	“I have done what I believe God wanted me to do,[1]” he said.
0	In fact, Fr.
1	Weinandy has bolstered my own “Great Clarifier” theory, saying that this pontificate, and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops, is being allowed by God in order to reveal “just how weak is the faith of many within the Church,” He added that Francis has revealed that many in the Church “hold harmful theological and pastoral views.”
0	Which inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.
0	When Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a “good” prelate being got rid of.
1	And it seems clear from the way it was done, and the way Francis treated Muller in general, that he was indeed got rid of.
0	But his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.
0	Ed Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he’s on.
1	A quick examination of Muller’s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is – so I am told by sources close to him – motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the “cool kids” in the Vatican, on the one hand, and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other.
0	Most recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, “Cardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of ‘Amoris Laetitia’” in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.
1	Signaling furiously with the trendy FrancisChurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence, Muller writes that “mitigating factors in guilt,” can lead, couples in “an uncertain marital situation” through a “path of repentance” – always “accompanied” by an exquisitely sensitive confessor – to a point where the reception of Communion is no longer sinful.
1	Presumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful.
0	Or sacrilege either, I guess.
0	Or something.
0	Somehow the “new evangelization” is involved in this, though it’s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it’s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can’t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.
1	We hear again, as we did incessantly from the Kasperians at the Synods, about the hard case of the poor, poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband, and who “finds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kind-hearted person,” … with whom, I guess, she has also no choice but to have sexual relations.
0	Because of kind-heartedness.
0	Anyway, the result of this is a “marriage-like relationship” about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things.
0	Or be too “extreme”.
1	It’s very important for him to avoid a “cheap adaptation to the relativistic Zeitgeist,” on one side, and a “cold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules,” on the other.
0	Because that could be too polarizing.
0	And mean.
0	And anyway, sins of the flesh aren’t the worst things ever.
0	There are, like, “different levels” of gravity, you know?
0	And, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?
0	“Spirit’s sins” like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than “sins of the flesh,” you know?
0	Which are, like, only a result of “human weakness,” right?
0	Apparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the “polarization” it has caused has been “regrettable”.
1	The question of Communion for divorced and civilly “remarried” Catholics, he said, has been “falsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of Catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal, in favor or against the pope.”
1	For years under Pope Benedict, Muller was engaged in an open war with the German episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow Communion for the divorced and remarried, no matter what Rome said, even threatening to go into schism if they didn’t get their way[2].
0	Muller, with little backing from Pope Benedict – who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences – and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line.
0	The fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.
0	And it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.
0	But since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides.
1	Reportedly removed from CDF – and of course lionized by “conservatives” – for his mild and equivocating opposition to Amoris Laetitia, Muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps.
0	With this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.
0	Perhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.
0	Weinandy’s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.
0	As my friend said, maybe “it’s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,” assuming there are any left.

0	[1] In this interview, Fr.
0	Weinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a “sign” that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: “If you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,” Weinandy recalls saying.
0	“Tomorrow morning, I’m going to Saint Mary Major’s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran.
0	After that, I’m coming back to Saint Peter’s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine.” “During that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time, and would never expect to see in Rome at this time.
0	That person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain.
0	Moreover, that person has to say to me, ‘Keep up the good writing’.” Weinandy said, exactly that happened the next day, in a chance meeting with an archbishop he’d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years, who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words, “Keep up the good writing.” “There was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something,” Weinandy said.
1	[2] It’s notable that these howling tantrums from the German bishops halted abruptly about the same time as Cardinal Kasper gave his infamous consistory speech in February 2014.
0	Barack Hussein Obama Hid Efforts to Aid Iran’s Windfall
0	A new Senate report reveals that Barack Obama secretly paved the way for Iran to tap into U.S. banks to convert cash it received from sanctions’ relief to dollars — despite the face the White House assured lawmakers it would do no such thing.
0	The report shows how State Department and Treasury Deparment officials during the Obama era quietly gave a special license for a major Omani bank to do business with two U.S. banks.
1	Barack Obama spent considerable time selling the American people on the idea of a cooperative Iran — all the while cutting quiet deals, behind closed doors, with the rogue nation.

0	Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?
0	The U.S. banks were pressured into complying with the deal.
0	The Washington Times has more:
1	The Obama administration — despite repeatedly assuring Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system — secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars, an investigative report by the Senate has revealed.
0	A copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities.
1	The document, compiled by the Senate’s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee, began circulating Tuesday, just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington’s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
1	“Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks, and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
0	She also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against “deceptive” Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.
0	The Iranian government “uses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks” as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran’s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said.
1	She issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities — the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump’s pullout from the nuclear accord.
0	Iranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord.
1	The president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions, which the U.S., Europe, China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran’s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections.
1	While Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal, the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded.
1	The warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump’s withdrawal.
1	The head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges.
0	He made the comment a day after Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.
0	The Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama’s team was willing to go to ensure the deal’s success as it was still being negotiated.
0	The Senate Homeland Security Committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.
0	“Senior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,” according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.
0	“Despite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.
0	“Even after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,” the report said.
0	Sen.
0	Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel’s findings Wednesday.
0	Under terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained “illegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.”
0	The ban included any “intermediary” transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran — a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.
0	On the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.
0	On Tehran’s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control.
0	According to the Senate report: “Muscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.
0	[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.”
0	Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would “continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.
0	“On February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,” according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made “even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”
0	Even as office of foreign assets control officials directly “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,” the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama “administration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.”
0	The catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange — in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.
0	Despite the Obama administration’s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.
1	Mr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that “the Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran.”
0	“Despite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,” Mr. Portman said.
0	“The only reason this transaction wasn’t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.”
0	Such sanctions, he added, “are a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.”

1	Google, once again, has been implicated in a story about how social media executives and employees are using their platforms to control and shutter conservative ideas.
0	This time?
0	This time, an email chain has emerged showing senior company executives pressing for the company to sway Latino voters to back Hillary Clinton.

1	Specifically, one executive suggests paying for the rides of Latinos to get them to the polls — if they vote for Clinton, that is.
0	First censorship, now this.
1	When will something be done about these tech and social media companies?
0	From Breitbart:
0	An email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.
1	In the emails, a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls–a get-out-the-vote for Hispanic voters operation–and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016.
1	She also used the term “silent donation” to describe Google’s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president.
0	The main email, headlined, “Election results and the Latino vote,” was sent on Nov. 9, 2016—the day after Clinton’s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election—by Eliana Murillo, Google’s Multicultural Marketing department head.
1	The four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non-partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another—only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump.
1	The critical miscalculation, Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email, was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead-up to the election.
1	Trump’s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away, and he hit even higher numbers—about 31 percent—in the key battleground state of Florida, Murillo admitted.
0	Murillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:
0	We worked very hard.
0	Many people did.
0	We pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices.
1	We kept our Google efforts non-partisan and followed our company’s protocols for the elections strategy.
0	We emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work.
1	Latinos voted in record-breaking numbers, particularly with early votes.
0	A large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.
0	We saw high traffic for the search queries ‘votar,’ ‘como votar,’ and ‘donde voter,’ in key states like Florida and Nevada.
0	We will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.
0	Without translating our tools the users wouldn’t have found the information they needed.
0	Objectively speaking, our goal was met — we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work.
0	I sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it.
0	Even Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.
0	“Sundar” presumably refers to Google’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015.
0	“Lisa” presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google—who forwarded Murillo’s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo’s activities with official company resources as having made a “great difference.” “Philipp” presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google’s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.
0	The emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.
0	Breitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.
0	Carlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller—raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.
1	Carlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and an expert on Google, who has said, in Carlson’s words, “Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it.”
0	Epstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.
1	Breitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein’s reports, including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters.
0	In his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained.
0	Carlson said:
1	This wasn’t a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say.
0	It wasn’t aimed at all potential voters.
0	It wasn’t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.
0	Google didn’t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles—they sometimes vote Republican.
1	It was aimed only at one group, a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.
0	Furthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign.
0	This was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting.
0	It was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.”
0	Carlson noted that in communication with Google, the company “did not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.”
1	“Their only defense was that the activities they described were either non-partisan or were not officially taken by the company,” Carlson said Monday night, describing Google’s official response to his requests for comment, before challenging the company’s response: “But of course they were both.
1	Plenty of people in Google knew what was going on and we haven’t seen any evidence anyone at Google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in.”
0	The email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:
0	We had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more.
0	We promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation’s non-partisan #YoVoyaVotaryTu (I’m going to vote, are you?)
1	campaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends’ reach to hit over 11M impressions with that hashtag.
1	We hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the Latino vote and the new research Nielsen published about the Latino electorate.
0	This reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.
1	We brought the same research to the LATISM conference, where people were beyond thrilled to see Google’s support and acknowledgment of the Latino community.
0	If Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story.
1	But she did not: She went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of Google’s actions, including a remarkable in-writing confirmation that at least one of Google’s actions amounted to a “silent donation”—something that could raise Federal Election Commission (FEC) red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter, now that these emails have been publicly revealed.
1	It is in the next paragraph that Murillo openly admits that Google made a “silent donation,” in her words, paying for rides to polls via leftist organization Voto Latino.
0	Murillo wrote in the next paragraph:
1	We also supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states (silent donation).
0	We even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).
0	We supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.
0	They were a strong partner, among many in this effort.
0	The next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.
0	“Ultimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,” Murillo wrote.
0	“We never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.
1	No one did.
1	We saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the ‘sleeping giant’ had awoken.”
0	On the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: “2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?”
1	Under that was a tweet from Jon Ralston of Ralston Reports in Nevada saying, among other things, that “Trump is dead” because of Latino turnout in early voting in the state.
0	Trump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states.
0	…
1	At that point, after the Ralston tweet, Murillo openly admits the partisan motives of Google’s electioneering efforts.
1	“On personal note, we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers,” Murillo wrote.
0	“We read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!”
1	Murillo’s email continues by including another headline, this time from the New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells: “Latino Voters Show Trump What It Means to Be American.” That piece was written on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election.
0	Then she begins writing again: “But then reality set in.
0	Only 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn’t enough.”
1	The third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a Latina woman in a red Make America Great Again hat and “Latinos for Trump” sign.
1	The story, from Ruben Navarette, Jr., published in the Daily Beast, is headlined: “Why the Latino Vote Didn’t Save America.” The sub-headline, “Hispanic voters were supposed to be one of Clinton’s blue firewalls—but one in three ended up splitting for Trump,” is also included in Murillo’s Google email.
0	From there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:
0	The voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida.
0	Latino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college.
0	We’ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.
0	We know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.
0	Thanks again for all your help and support in this effort.
1	In the next paragraph, Murillo again openly admits she was not “objective” when it came to the election.
0	“I have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,” Murillo wrote.
1	“This is devastating for our Democratic Latino community.
0	After all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all.
0	We are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don’t know what the future holds for them.”
1	After that, Murillo says she cannot communicate with key organizers of the effort by Google and its partners—a project known as HOLA—because she is afraid of secret pro-Trump spies on the listservs created.
1	She also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving Hillary Clinton supporters hugs after Trump crushed her on election day.
1	She also says those involved in Google’s get-out-the-vote efforts were openly seeking consolation after Clinton lost, and that she and another person cried after Trump won – for the first time they have cried due to an election result.
0	Murillo wrote:
0	What’s most difficult for us is we can’t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.
1	There is a thread right now among the core HOLA group where people are sharing how much they hurt, how much they need support right now, and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other.
0	One in a remote office said ‘If you guys do any sort of meetings, I’d love to join virtually.
0	I think I’m currently the only Latinx in my office.
0	It’s kinda hard.’ #understatement.
1	Another said, ‘I’ve never cried after an election until last night.’ Same here.
0	She was not done there.
1	In the next paragraph, Murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly.
1	She also admits the election result was a “loss,” another indication that Google’s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect Democrat Clinton over Republican Trump and influence the results of the election.
0	She also says that the company—and herself in particular—will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.
1	“I’m in shock and it hurts more than I could have ever imagined, but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high,” Murillo wrote.
0	“Loss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative.
0	My partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing — time to keep working harder.”
1	At the top of the fourth page of the email, Murillo asks her colleagues at Google to give out a “smile” to grieving leftist Latinos who work at the company.
0	“If you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,” Murillo wrote.
1	“They are probably hurting right now.
0	It’s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever.
0	At least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.”
0	Then, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to “celebrate” a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation “will be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.”
0	Murillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.
0	“I’m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,” she wrote.
1	This email leaked to Fox News and Breitbart News and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that Google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President of the United States.
1	This email from Murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside Google.
0	Her original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.
1	“Thought you all would want to read this,” Gevelber wrote in her own message endorsing Murillo’s email in a message to other Google bigwigs.
0	“It’s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.”
1	Gevelber continued by commending everyone she said, “worked so hard to ensure all the Get out the Vote were done in Spanish” that their efforts “made a giant difference” in the election “to Googlers and beyond.”
1	President Trump and Republicans have just begun scratching the surface of bias against them among Silicon Valley’s elite, including, perhaps foremost alongside Facebook, from Google.
0	A source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes.

1	Ramadan Jihad 2018 Death Toll So Far Is 218
1	Another Ramadan is upon us, and the jihad death toll so far stands at 218 Infidels, murdered in 53 jihad attacks.
1	Once again this year we see that Ramadan is quintessentially the month of jihad.
1	A jihad group explained it back in 2012: “The month of Ramadan is a month of holy war and death for Allah.
1	It is a month for fighting the enemies of Allah and God’s messenger, the Jews and their American facilitators.” Referring to a jihad attack that happened at that time, the message continued: “One of our groups aided by Allah managed to bomb a bus full of Jewish tourists, plunderers of holy lands, after careful tracking.
1	The holy war is not confined to a particular arena and we shall fight the Jews and the Americans until they leave the land of Islam.”
1	In contrast, President Trump issued a statement claiming that “Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life.”

0	So which is it?
1	Does Ramadan remind us of “the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,” or is Ramadan “a month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers”?
1	Islam’s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth.
0	During Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah.
0	Hence it is a time when they’re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims.
1	However, the Qur’an says: “Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves” (48:29).
1	If the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout, the Muslim who applies himself diligently to the Ramadan observance will simultaneously become more both merciful to his fellow Muslims and more severe against the unbelievers.
1	Murdering infidels thus doesn’t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it.
1	The Kavkaz Center, a website operated by Chechen jihadists, explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad’s time: “The month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming.
1	The greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) occurred in this blessed month, the month of jihad, zeal and enthusiasm.”
1	Trump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that “Ramadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,” and was severely misleading the American people.
0	Ironically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone.
0	After all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them.
1	Shadi Hamid of the Qatar-funded Brookings Institution declared: “Trump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist, but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence.
1	Great!
1	Putting all that context aside, it’s offensive and pretty much terrible.”
0	Why?
0	Because Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism.
0	Hamid continued: “We, as American Muslims, shouldn’t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with.
1	We’re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive.”
1	What is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst.
1	There is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them.
1	Meanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad.
1	And as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.

0	The Islamization of the Public Schools
0	Muslims anxious to use schools and textbooks to proselytize for Islam have found a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism.
1	With the imperative to be “tolerant” robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically, all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S.-based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor, Saudi Arabia, to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines.
0	Many of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded.
1	They make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro-Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing.
1	The taboo about teaching religion in the public schools, so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades, is increasingly set aside in American public schools, as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact.

0	We have seen this just recently, when Mountain Ridge Middle School in Gerrardstown, West Virginia instructed students to copy out the Islamic profession of faith (shahada), ostensibly as a calligraphy exercise.
0	Parent Rich Penkoski recounted: “I saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.
0	Their excuse was calligraphy.
0	I was like, ‘Whoa!
0	Whoa!
0	Whoa!’ First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad.
0	The fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.
0	I said, ‘That is not happening.
0	My daughter is not doing that.’ My daughter told me that if she didn’t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip.”
0	Branch contradicted Penkoski, claiming: “The teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.
0	She has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents.” He said that Christianity and Judaism were given “equitable treatment” in the same class.
0	Penkoski’s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam.
0	Penkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: “Notice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord’s Prayer.
0	[There’s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.”
1	This stealth proselytizing is nationwide.
1	Last January, parents filed a federal complaint against Chatham Middle School in Chatham, New Jersey, for forcing students to watch videos that proselytized for Islam.
1	One video, according to the complaint, describes “Christians and Jews as ‘infidels’ and prais[es] Muhammad in gruesome detail for slaughtering them.” Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as “replete with biased, chastising statements encouraging the students…to follow the Quran and become Muslim.” Another video, according to Hilsenrath, depicts a Muslim boy teaching his non-Muslim friend about Islam, after which both go to “learn how to pray.”
0	The complaint adds: “Due to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.”
0	These accounts are not singular.
0	High school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, “pretended to be Muslims in the ‘Islamic’ city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.” The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article.
1	Judicial Watch Senior Investigator Bill Marshall remarked: “Citizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Dr. Bill Saxton, chairman of Citizens for National Security, said that the assignment was a “purposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the ‘virtues’ of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.”
0	Meanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: “My daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,” while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments.
0	One homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: “Allah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,” with students having to fill in the blank with “same God.”
1	Parent Steve Alsup added: “It seemed like half the truth to me, they didn’t talk about the extreme Islamics.” Kim Embry, a spokesperson for Walton County Public Schools, said revealingly: “We are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching.”
0	Indeed.
1	In 2015, students at Spring Hill Middle School in Spring Hill, Tennessee were forced as part of an assignment to write, “There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.” Mother Joy Ellis remarked: “This is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP.
1	I didn’t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.” Another mother, Brandee Porterfield, observed: “It really did bother me that they skipped the whole chapter on the rise of Christianity and they spent three weeks just studying Islam….I spoke with the teacher and the principal,” she said.
0	“They are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter.
0	Even though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.”
1	Maury County Director of Schools, Chris Marczak, defended the curriculum: “It is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate.” Porterfield, however, shot back: “They are not going over anything else.
1	So for the students to have to memorize this prayer, it does seem like it is indoctrination.”
0	None of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise.
0	Multiculturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one’s own.
0	The embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill.
0	Certainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way.
0	They would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and multiculturalism.
0	Unfortunately, in the end, it amounts to the same thing.

1	The Guardian reported Thursday that “Chris Bryant, a senior Labour backbencher,” has written to British prime minister Theresa May, urging her to “issue an official ban on Donald Trump from entering the UK on the grounds he is condoning fascism and his presence is ‘not conducive to the public good.'”
1	When Western historians look back at the 21st century, the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. will be viewed as one of that once great nation’s darkest moments and a low point for freedom.
1	It was the victory of Islamic law over Western law, sharia over freedom.
0	This because Trump retweeted three videos showing Muslims being violent.
1	Bryant, a former Foreign Office minister, supported this madness by pointing to…me.
0	He cited the cases of two U.S. far-right bloggers, Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, who were banned by May in 2013 from entering the U.K.
1	I was going to be among a group of freedom-fighters – a true rainbow coalition of human rights activists from all over the world (a Hindu princess had been set to join us) – to honor the memory of Lee Rigby, the British soldier who had been murdered on a London street in broad daylight by an Islamic jihadist on May 22, 2013.
0	We planned to pay our respects to Lee Rigby by placing a wreath at his memorial, in his memory and in memory of his service.
0	We planned to bring the Stars and Stripes, as well as British and Danish flags, and participate in Armed Forces Day memorial commemorations at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, where Rigby served.
0	For this, we were banned.
1	When Prime Minister Theresa May, who was the head of the Home Office when she banned us and was thus directly responsible for the ban, threw us under the bus in order to satiate savages who threatened violence, did she really think she or anyone would be safe?
0	Safe by surrender?
0	When did they ever work in the history of humankind?
0	The über-left pol citing the Geller-Spencer ban in the U.K. to ban Trump was inevitable.
0	It’s like the Geller ban on ads on buses and subways in every major American city: the Catholic Church just tried to run ads on buses in Washington, D.C., and discovered that it couldn’t because of the ban on all political ads that was enacted in order to prevent my ads from running.

0	Who decides what’s good and what’s forbidden in a totalitarian society?
0	The totalitarians.
1	The worldwide howl at Trump’s retweets of videos tweeted out by a British politician is further proof of the Islamization of the West.
0	It speaks to how deeply and far and widely sharia has been normed and accepted by Western elites.
0	The videos in the retweets are authentic and have circulated for years.
0	They’re neither “far-right” nor “Islamophobic”; they’re just factual.
1	Once again the media are blaming the messenger instead of dealing with Islamic violence.
0	Trump didn’t add any rhetoric to his tweets.
0	He retweeted authentic videos.
0	(The Dutch media now claim that one of them doesn’t depict Muslim migrants being violent, as was claimed.
1	Even if this is true, Muslim migrant violence is a grim and increasingly common reality in Europe.)
1	If Muslims sincerely condemn jihad terror and sharia oppression, they shouldn’t oppose him.
0	In a letter to May, Bryant wrote: “I am writing to you to ask you and the home secretary to take immediate action to ban the president of the United States, Donald Trump, from entering the United Kingdom, due to his apparent support for far-right groups in this country.
0	In retweeting Jayda Fransen’s posts, it is absolutely clear to me that President Trump is supporting and condoning fascism and far-right activity.
0	This activity has frequently taken the form of violence on our streets.
0	Ms Fransen herself has a long history of racism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal.
0	Many of the people you have rightly banned from entering the UK were guilty of less than this.”
1	“Fascism.” By that Bryant means “defending British values.”
1	While admitting numerous jihad preachers, Britain is keeping out the voices of sanity that would call that nation back to a path that would secure freedom for her children and her children’s children instead of a path to national suicide.
0	And now a call to ban the president of the nation that saved their nation from extinction not 70 years ago.

1	Florida gubernatorial candidate and George Soros-backed Andrew Gillum may have just been completely undercut by a member of his own staff.
0	Not that his racist, anti-semite claims against his opponent weren't enough, one of his staffers has been caught in an undercover video saying, “None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen” and that is to be kept confidential from the public.
0	In a new undercover video from Project Veritas, Omar Smith, who is a staffer for Gillum and claims to have also attended college with him, said that if Gillum is elected “None of the programs that people are hoping for would happen.”

0	U.S. warns of 'sonic attacks' in China
0	BEIJING -- The U.S. State Department is warning U.S. citizens in China that a government employee reported unusual "sensations of sound and pressure" and was later diagnosed with a mild traumatic brain injury -- a case that recalls a wave of so-called sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba.
0	A health alert sent Wednesday said a U.S. government employee assigned to the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou reported "subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure."
0	The notification said the department was not aware of any other cases inside or outside the diplomatic community.
0	But signaling the depth of their concern, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and all five U.S. consulates in the country held town hall meetings Wednesday so employees could ask questions and raise concerns.
0	State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said the United States will send a medical team to Guangzhou next week to conduct baseline medical evaluations of all employees who desire one.
0	"The department is taking this incident very seriously and is working to determine the cause and impact of the incident," Nauert said.
0	Though the State Department has not linked this case to any other incident, news of unusual symptoms hitting U.S. government employees recalled a rash of incidents with U.S. and Canadian diplomats working in Cuba.
0	The United States last year decided to withdraw a large number of embassy staff from Cuba after diplomats stationed there complained of symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, visual difficulties, headaches and fatigue.
0	The American Foreign Service Association said then that government employees had been diagnosed with "mild traumatic brain injury and permanent hearing loss, with such additional symptoms as loss of balance, severe headaches, cognitive disruption, and brain swelling."
0	Details about the Guangzhou case are still emerging.
0	Jinnie Lee, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said that from late 2017 to April 2018, a government employee assigned to Guangzhou reported a variety of physical symptoms.
0	The employee was sent to the United States for evaluation and treatment.
0	On May 18, the embassy learned that the diagnosis was mild traumatic brain injury.
0	"The medical indications are very similar, and entirely consistent with, the medical indications that were taking place to Americans working in Cuba," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday during testimony in Congress.
0	"The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures," Lee said.
0	The health alert advised that U.S. citizens in China should consult a medical professional if they experience any symptoms.
0	"While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source," the alert advised.
0	"Instead, move to a location where the sounds are not present."

0	Austrian bishop forcefully rejects German Bishops’ idea of blessing homosexual unions
0	NewsCatholic Church
0	SALZBURG, Austria, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode – the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops' Conference – and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day.
0	Now Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun – one of the signatories of the Kazakh “Profession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage” – has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany.
0	In the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.
0	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1	Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!
1	And your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.
0	A clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.
0	Cardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.
1	Why not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?
0	Now, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.
0	The Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:
0	For Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service – whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.
0	The blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.
0	Some blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.
0	But parents can bless their children.
0	The faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them.
0	[...]
0	What kind of hope is connected with a blessing?
0	With regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection – sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.
0	With the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought.
0	[…]
1	To bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it.
0	The blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.
0	[…]
0	But now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.
1	That is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense.
1	Therefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.
1	If one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women.
0	Of course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.
0	This blessing – which is not related to their acts – is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!
1	This position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented – since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] – by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA); by the German-speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus Büning.
1	I am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know.
1	Dear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!
0	And your addition “in individual cases” is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.
0	What would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an “individual case”!
0	The idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: “Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.” [Isaiah 5:20]
0	Is this not exactly what Cardinal Marx – and others who are thinking like him – are doing?
0	If one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag “honey,” the cucumbers still remain sour!
0	Even blessing bishops cannot change that.
0	Nor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it.
1	He says that he “allows himself” to talk like that – but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish.
0	That seems to catch on these days.
0	For example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!
1	To contradict two popes – whom the Church has already “beatified” the one and “canonized” the other – so shortly after their deaths, and in such a radical and open manner, probably has never happened before in the Church's history.
1	Isaiah says that such people draw unto them God's punishment, with thick cords!
0	Nevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well.
0	Whether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.
1	Democrats Want Us To Believe All Women…Unless They’re Accusing Keith Ellison, Bill Clinton, Al Franken Or George Soros
0	The Democrats have called upon the Senate to postpone the vote on Kavanaugh.
0	Establishment Republicans are racing for the exits.
0	But over what?
0	An unprovable accusation from decades ago that the accuser said nothing about until years later, and that is uncorroborated by any other testimony or by the evidence of any similar behavior on Kavanaugh’s part.
1	This is clearly a set-up (Christine Ford is also a far-left Democrat operative) designed to derail the nomination of a good man.
1	There is no low to which the Democrats will not sink to attain their nefarious goals of stopping the President from strengthening America and protecting Americans.

0	“Weighing the Allegations against Brett Kavanaugh,” by David French, National Review, September 16, 2018:
0	They’re serious but not solid.
0	The allegations against Brett Kavanaugh — outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford — are substantial and serious.
0	She claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.
0	Here’s the core of her story:
0	While his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.
0	When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.
0	“I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.
0	“He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.” Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh’s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.
0	She said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.
0	Do not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.
0	I went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.
1	This isn’t “boys will be boys.” Actions have consequences, and it’s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this — even a long time ago — he has to remain “merely” a judge on the D.C.
0	Circuit Court of Appeals.
0	Since Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.
0	At the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.
0	Yet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.
0	We don’t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.
0	I have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton — or for any other politician who’s accused of misconduct.
0	Is it more likely than not that the allegation is true?
0	Given the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.
0	I believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.
0	I believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.
0	But the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.
1	So far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment.
0	Here’s why:
0	First, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.
0	Did the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?
0	With Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.
0	Here, there was not.
0	According to the Washington Post, “Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.”
0	That’s almost three decades of silence — three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.
0	But even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.
0	They actually contradict her story on a key detail.
0	According to the Post, “The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part.
0	Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.” Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh’s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.
1	Those are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.
1	As a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails.
1	Juries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes — after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn’t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.
0	At least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.
0	If there were only four boys there, who were the other two?
0	Let’s hear from them.
0	In fact, investigators should interview everyone else at the party.
0	Yet given all the years that have passed, would it be possible to find anyone who remembers being at that party?
0	Would they remember any details at all?
1	If someone saw Kavanaugh stumbling drunk at the party, that would obviously bolster Ford’s account.
0	If another attendee says, “He was totally sober and with me the whole time,” that helps Kavanaugh.
0	But the odds of getting details that precise are long indeed, and there is always a chance that a motivated classmate might lie — for either person….
0	Brett Kavanaugh accused in letter obtained by FBI of drunkenly forcing himself on woman while in high school; Kavanaugh denies it happened
0	According to the New York Daily News, Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, held a woman down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her while drunk at a party in high school.
0	That’s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
0	The unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Md., according to the NYDN, which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday.
0	She alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both of whom had been drinking, cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests.
0	Kavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman’s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her, but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room.
1	Kavanaugh, 53, vehemently denied the woman’s allegations.
1	“I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,” he said in a statement.
0	“I did not do this back in high school or at any time.”
0	Kavanaugh’s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman’s claims but told the New Yorker he has “no recollection of that.”
0	The woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident.
0	She first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.
0	Eshoo’s office declined to comment.
0	The woman’s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night.
0	An FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation.
0	According to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved “honorably” and treaded “women with respect.”
0	The women also said that Kavanaugh has “stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.”
0	“Judge Kavanaugh has denied this allegation and over 60 women – with a broad range of political views – who’ve known him since high school, have sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,” says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network.
1	“This is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, and there should no delay in confirming Judge Kavanaugh.”
1	Muslim Dem IT Aides' Family Member Paid $45,000 After Hiring Attorney Specializing In Money Laundering Cases
1	Abid Awan, a member of a family of highly paid Democratic IT aides, was awarded a $45,000 payout in court after he enlisted a high profile attorney specializing in money laundering cases to defeat his stepmother in a bitter dispute over his father’s life insurance policy.
0	Awan removed the stepmother, Samina Gilani, as the longstanding beneficiary of the policy and replaced her with himself around the period of his father’s death, according to legal and insurance papers.
0	The stepmother, Samina Gilani, also claimed in 2017 that Abid’s brother Imran Awan held her in “captivity” and wiretapped and extorted her, weeks after the House Office of Inspector General separately alleged that they made “unauthorized access” to congressmen’s data.

1	Abid’s attorney James Bacon mocked the elderly, burka-clad widow, who does not drive and speaks only Uurdu.
1	“She’s a wacko lunatic, what are you going to do?” he said just outside the courtroom doors as the judge took a break to deliberate.
0	The Daily Caller News Foundation was present at the court hearing.
0	Associates and relatives have long accused the family of green.
1	“For the sake of money they would have done anything,” Gilani’s cousin, Syed Ahmed, told the Daily Mail.
1	“There are possibilities that [Imran] or them might have been selling [House] information,” he added.
0	(Syed Ahmed knew Abid well enough to loan him money, according to bankruptcy documents filed by Abid.)
0	The FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family’s activities involving House computers.
0	“Based on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time” and “there are strong indications of flight in this case,” prosecutors wrote.
0	Abid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy.
1	On Nov. 16, 2016, the brothers made a video of his bedridden father signing over ownership — but not changing the beneficiary — of his life insurance policy to Abid.
0	Abid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.
0	When his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani’s lawyer said would have kept her from the money.
0	A Virginia court later ruled that Jamal’s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong.
1	“Why is that even relevant?” Bacon said of Jamal’s misstatement at the March 7 court date.
0	On Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi – who was also on the House payroll – began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses.
0	In January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan.
0	Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment.
0	On Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.
0	The life insurance change’s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it.
0	Ten weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company.
0	In addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless.
0	Abid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors.
0	At that time, he filed forms “under penalty of perjury” that two houses were needed as “my spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.”
0	However, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova – who also was on the House payroll – signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as “spouse of Abid,” and they have been photographed living together.
0	Gilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to “assets of my late husband in Pakistan,” which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy.
1	Americo, the life insurance company, said there was “great doubt” about who the rightful policy holder was, given the allegations of fraud, and sent the decision to the courts to sort out on April 14, two months after the House sargent-at-arms banned the Awans for “suspicious activity.”
0	Gilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband’s possessions.
0	The only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships.
0	He lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents.
1	Hadeed did not introduce any evidence to the judge about a pattern of possible fraud by Abid, the timing of the move as it relates to the federal criminal case, or the mental capacity of the dying man to understand paperwork.
0	Hadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language.
0	After court, Hadeed told reporters Bacon had threatened to sue him for defamation.
0	“I don’t want to subject myself to that,” he said outside court.
0	“I don’t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.”
0	In court, Bacon badgered Hadeed.
0	“Are you going to share any more info with them?
0	I hope not.
0	I hope you learned that lesson,” he said.
1	“You have no control over [Gilani], do you?
1	You’re like, talking to a wall,” he said of Gilani.
0	Hadeed said three different signatures from Abid on financial documents did not match, and put a defiant Abid on the witness stand.
1	Hadeed: Why do your signatures look different?
1	Abid: My signatures are not very consistent, I’m just a human being…
0	Hadeed: You were aware you were changing beneficiary from your father’s spouse to yourself?
0	Abid: That was my father’s request…
0	Hadeed: You’re not answering the question.
0	Abid: I’m not very smart, so it takes a while sometimes…
1	Judge: I don’t understand why the witness is having such trouble with the question.
0	Your job is to answer the question.
0	In court documents, Gilani alleged, “while he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed/planted in my house … Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police.
1	[Imran] threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again [he] will do harm to me.” She said that Imran eventually agreed to remove the listening devices and did so in front of her.
0	Based on Hadeed’s narrow legal argument about the life insurance contract’s language, the judge ruled that, “The son as the owner of the policy has the absolute right to change the beneficiary.”
0	After Gilani retained a lawyer, Bacon had offered a settlement where they’d split the money, but Gilani declined it.
0	The court awarded Abid the $50,000 life insurance payout, minus $5,000 that the insurance company took for its expenses in litigating the fraud allegations.
0	“You should have taken the settlement.
0	Now she’s not getting a penny,” Bacon said in court.
0	“You’re not getting anything.”
0	Gilani said after court that her conscience didn’t allow her to settle.
0	“I didn’t do the deal because they had been adopting bad behaviors.
0	I cannot agree to that.
0	It wasn’t about the money,” she said.

0	Vote targeting Jewish student politician was not anti-Semitic: McGill report
0	MONTREAL – It was political disagreement — not anti-Semitism — that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council’s board of directors, an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded.
1	But Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed, saying it missed the significance of an anti-Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed from the board last fall.
0	A joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, “appears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.”
0	The controversy has its roots in McGill’s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.
0	At an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious.
0	Supporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote.
0	In the past they had been ratified as a bloc.
1	The first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved, but when they got to Lew, the only Jewish director, he was rejected 105 to 73.
1	In a subsequent Facebook post, Lew wrote, “My Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.”
1	An outcry followed, leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau, to investigate.
0	She also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.
0	Boudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation.
0	His findings, he wrote, do “not substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,” which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews.
0	Rather, he found, votes against Lew were “motivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement.” Protests about Israel’s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew’s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was “honest and even understandable.”
0	A statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU.
0	Boudreau’s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October.
1	Democratize SSMU deleted the message, which targeted Lew and two other candidates, after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was “insensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.”
0	The Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric “was used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew.
0	It is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.”
0	They say Boudreau’s report “insinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political office.”
0	Lew was restored to his post as a director last month after a ruling that the split vote in October had violated the SSMU constitution.
0	He was not immediately available for comment.
1	Michael Mostyn, CEO of B’nai Brith Canada, called the report a whitewash.
0	“The report does not present a full or accurate picture of the hostile atmosphere facing Jewish students at McGill,” he said in a statement.
0	Fortier said the university’s next actions will be based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life, due to report in April.
1	“I would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses,” she said in a statement.

1	Jewish and Pro-Israel Students Kicked Off University Board for Opposing BDS
0	First they came for the Jews.
0	And then they came for everyone else.
0	Jewish students have already faced plenty of harassment and hate at McGill.
1	The latest incident at the Canadian university comes with a rather blatant agenda.
1	A Jewish student at McGill University has been kicked off the student government board for having “conflicts of interest” due to his pro-Israel activism.
0	Third-year student Noah Lew was one of 12 board members up for general assembly ratification on Monday evening following his victory as vice-president finance of the Arts Undergraduate Society.
0	The ratification vote is typically a mere formality, but Monday’s was different due to Democratize Student Society of McGill University (SSMU), an organization that was established to resist the university’s ban of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement on campus.
0	Democratize SSMU was able to pass a motion that required each board member to be voted upon separately under the grounds that they weren’t a fan of the names.
0	When it was Lew’s turn, he was voted down, 105 to 73 with 12 abstaining, with applause following the vote.
0	Two other students who had criticized BDS, Alexander Scheffel and Josephine Wright O’Manique, were also voted down.
0	Democratize SSMU had targeted Lew and the other two students on the board because they had connections to the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee (CJPAC) and were involved in getting the BDS ban passed, which Democratize SSMU claimed were “conflicts of interests.”
0	Somehow I don't think being a member of a Muslim student group and supporting BDS would be considered a conflict of interest.
1	But the campus anti-Israel crowd has been working rather hard to intimidate and penalize anyone involved in pro-Israel organizations.
1	And to keep their racist boycott movement going by maintaining control over student governments.
0	Lew shared the experience on Facebook.
1	“I have no doubt from the information circulated about me and campaign run against me prior to this vote that this was about my Jewish identity, and nothing more,” wrote Lew.
0	“I was blocked from being able to participate in my student government because I am Jewish, because I have been affiliated with Jewish organizations, and because I believe in the right to Jewish self-determination.” Lew added that the experience shows the inherent anti-Semitism in the BDS movement.
1	“If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why did a BDS-led campaign name and shame me for my affiliation with a Jewish organization, and call on students to remove me from student government for this reason?” wrote Lew.
1	“If BDS is not anti-Semitic, why was I barred from participating in student government because of my Jewish identity?”
0	There are some more details here and a petition.
0	On Monday night, three students were removed from the Board of Directors of the Students’ Society of McGill University (SSMU), McGill’s main student government.
0	All three were targeted for removal either because they are Jewish or have vocally opposed anti-Jewish discrimination on campus.
1	This episode is utterly unacceptable, and is merely the latest in a long string of antisemitic incidents at your university.
0	Indeed, according to eyewitnesses, one of the members of the mob that removed the three directors was Igor Sadikov.
1	You will remember Sadikov as the student politician who in February told his followers to “punch a Zionist today.” It is unclear whether Sadikov has faced any disciplinary action for this incitement to violence from your administration.
0	Antisemitism at McGill does not emerge from a vacuum.
1	Rather, it has been nurtured in part by a toxic campus press, especially the McGill Daily, a publication which openly refuses to publish any “Zionist” content.
1	In practice, this prevents McGill’s Jewish community from defending itself against the absurd attacks to which it is subjected.
0	If the Daily is committed to systematically excluding the voices of an ethno-religious community on campus, then it cannot continue to receive automatic student funding, as it does now.
0	The double standard here is pretty clear.
1	And we know exactly what the reaction would be if a student paper refused to publish any pro-Islamist content.

0	At the same time, according to military planning documents, the majority of the crowd might dissolve along their long journey to the US.
1	While the US still has very little intel about the composition of the migrant caravans, one way or the other the White House plans to outmatch the number of potential illegals and, if not, suppress them with brutal force.
0	Currently, Washington has allocated roughly the same number of troops it has committed to fighting Islamic State in Syria (2,000) and Iraq (5,000).

1	Obama’s Treason: Even Worse Than We Thought
0	The Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday that “the Obama administration skirted key U.S. sanctions to grant Iran access to billions in hard currency despite public assurances the administration was engaged in no such action, according to a new congressional investigation.”
1	And it gets even worse: “The investigation, published Wednesday by the House Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, further discloses secret efforts by top Obama administration officials to assure European countries they would receive a pass from U.S. sanctions if they engaged in business with Iran.”
0	This revelation comes after the news that came to light in February, that, according to Bill Gertz in the Washington Times, “the U.S. government has traced some of the $1.7 billion released to Iran by the Obama administration to Iranian-backed terrorists in the two years since the cash was transferred.”
0	There is a law that applies to this situation.
1	U.S. Code 2381 says: “Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.”
1	In a sane political environment, Barack Obama would be tried for treason.
1	Barack Hussein Obama has planted seeds that will be bearing bitter fruit for years, and probably decades, to come.
1	He is, without any doubt, the worst President in American history.
0	Fillmore, Pierce, Buchanan?
0	Yes, the doughface Presidents made the Civil War inevitable, but worse came later.
0	Grant?
1	Blind to corruption and out of his depth, but there have been worse than he as well.
0	Wilson?
1	That black-hearted Presbyterian bigot arguably gave the world Hitler and World War II, so he is definitely in the Final Four.
0	Harding?
0	Nah: his tax cuts and return to “normalcy” got the American economy, and the Twenties, roaring.
0	FDR and LBJ gave us the modern welfare state and dependent classes automatically voting Democrat; the full bill on the damage they did hasn’t yet been presented.
0	Nixon?
1	A crook and an economic Leftist, who betrayed Taiwan for the People’s Republic; his record certainly isn’t good.
0	Carter?
1	Nothing good can be said about his four years of sanctimony and incompetence.
1	But there is one thing Barack Obama has on all competitors: treason.
0	He showered hundreds of billions of dollars on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
0	There are those who say, “It was their money.
0	It belonged to the Iranian government but was frozen and not paid since 1979.” Indeed, and there was a reason for that: not even Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah’s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah.
0	Likewise Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush all thought that the Islamic Republic was not due money that was owed to the Shah.
0	Only Barack Obama did.
1	The definition of treason is giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
1	The leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran order their people to chant “Death to America” in mosques every Friday, and repeatedly vow that they will ultimately destroy the United States of America and the state of Israel.
1	How was giving them billions and helping them skirt sanctions applied by the U.S. government not treason?
1	Other Presidents have been incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, but which has committed treason on a scale to rival the treason of Barack Obama?
1	The Iranians also operate a global network of jihad terror organizations, one of which, Hizballah, is quite active in Mexico now, with the obvious ultimate intention of crossing the border and committing jihad massacres of Americans.
1	Obama has given a tremendous boost to these initiatives, as well as to Iran’s nuclear program, with his nuclear deal that has given the Iranians hundreds of billions of dollars and essentially a green light to manufacture nuclear weapons, in exchange for absolutely nothing.
0	There is no telling when the worst consequences of Obama’s aid and comfort to the Islamic Republic of Iran will be felt.
0	But they likely will be felt in one way or another.
0	Even as President Trump moves swiftly to restore sanctions and put Iran on notice that its nuclear activity and global adventurism will not be tolerated, those billions cannot be recovered, and the Iranians have already spent a great deal for their jihad cause.
1	However this catastrophe plays out, there is one man who will suffer no consequences whatsoever: Barack Obama.
0	That’s Leftist Privilege.
0	It’s good to be a powerful Leftist in Washington nowadays.
0	Laws?
0	Pah!
0	Laws are for conservatives.
0	Not So Fast
1	It’s got to be either one of the stupidest acts that I can recall or a very wicked plan by Washington neocons to sabotage Korean peace talks.
1	How else to describe the decision by Big Brother USA and junior sidekick South Korea to stage major air force exercises on North Korea’s border.
1	The prickly North Koreans had a fit, of course, as always when the US flexes its muscles on their borders.
1	Continuing South and North Korean peace talks scheduled this week were cancelled by the furious North Koreans.
1	The much ballyhooed Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-un is now threatened with cancellation or delay.
0	Who can blame the North Koreans for blowing their tops?
1	As Trump administration mouthpieces were gabbing about peace and light, the US Air Force was getting ready to fly B-52 heavy bombers and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters around North Korea’s borders and missile-armed subs lurked at sea.
1	This provocation was the first of two major spring military exercises planned by the US and its reluctant South Korean satrap.

1	In a policy one could call ‘eat sand and die,’ Trump demanded that Iran not only give up any and all nuclear capacity (Iran has no nukes), but also junk its non-nuclear armed medium range missiles, stop backing the Palestinians, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, roll over and be good, don’t do anything to upset Israel, and pull out of Syria.
1	In short, a total surrender policy leading to future regime change.
0	Hardly an encouragement for North Korea.
0	North Korea was right on target when it accused arch-neocon John Bolton of trying to sabotage the peace deal.
0	In 2005-2006, Bolton served as the Bush administration’s ambassador to the UN.
0	He established a tradition for the post of being anti-Muslim, pro-Israel and anti-Russian, a policy continued to this day by the current US UN rep, loud-mouthed neocon Nikki Haley.
0	In the 2005-2006 period, after years of negotiations, the US and North Korea were close to a nuclear/peace deal.
0	Enter John Bolton.
0	He succeeded in sabotaging the US-North Korea deal.
0	Why?
1	Because Bolton, as an arch neocon, was fanatically pro-Israel and feared that North Korea might provide nuclear technology to Israel’s foes.
0	As usual with the neocons, Israel’s interests came before those of the United States.
0	Trump’s newly named Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, is also an ardent neocon.
0	Last week, Bolton went onto US TV and actually suggested North Korea might follow the course set by Libya, of all places.
0	Libya’s then ruler, Muammar Kadaffi, bought some nuclear equipment from Pakistan so he could hand it over to the US as a gesture of cooperation after the Bush administration invaded Iraq.
1	The handover was done with much fanfare, then the US, France and Britain attacked Libya and overthrew Kadaffi.
1	The hapless Libyan leader was eventually murdered by French agents.
0	War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $2.60 Buy New $24.57 (as of 09:00 EDT - Details)
1	Is this what Bolton has in mind for North Korea?
0	The Northerners certainly seemed to think so.
0	Some wondered if Bolton and perhaps Pompeo were trying to sabotage the North Korea deal.
1	Or were at least being incredibly obtuse and belligerent.
1	Was Trump involved in this intrigue?
0	Hard to tell.
0	But he can’t be happy.
1	His minions and bootlickers are promoting Trump for the Nobel Prize – rather ahead of events.
0	Or was the US military rattling its sabers and trying to protect its huge investments in North Asia?
0	The Pentagon takes a dim view of the proposed Korean nuclear accords.
1	The burst of sweetness and light coming from Pyongyang just sounds too good to be true.
0	Veteran Korea observers, this writer included, find it hard to believe Kim Jong-un will give up his nuclear weapons, particularly after seeing Trump’s deceit in dealing with Iran and Kadaffi’s murder.
0	Speaking of de-nuclearization, why does North Korea not demand that the US get rid of its nuclear weapons based in South Korea, Okinawa, Guam and with the 7th Fleet?
0	Many are targeted on North Korea.
0	US nuclear weapons are based on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
0	Others are secretly based in Japan.
0	Why not demand the US pull out all its 28,500 troops in South Korea and some 2,000 military technicians at air bases?
0	Conclusively halt those spring and fall military maneuvers that raise the threat of war.
0	End the trade embargo of North Korea that amounts to high level economic warfare.

1	Anti-Gay Imam Featured Yet Again at Florida Democrat Gala
0	The Democratic Party promotes itself as an advocacy group for all matters concerning homosexuals and labels politicians, who take stances opposite theirs on politically charged issues such as same-sex marriage, as bigots.
0	Yet, the party keeps on inviting an imam, who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals, to participate at its annual functions.
1	This blatant hypocrisy shows the political bankruptcy of their leadership’s claims to be pro-gay and anti-bigotry and reveals their intention to pander to those in the Muslim community who spew intolerance and would wish others harm.
0	On Saturday, October 7, 2017, the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson (TKJ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel, in West Palm Beach, Florida.
0	The Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe.
0	Other speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party.
0	Prior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam.
0	The imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals.
0	Shafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida.
0	The mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity.
1	“Dirty Bomber” Jose Padilla was a student of Shafayat Mohamed’s at Darul Uloom.
0	Now-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom.
0	And Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory.
0	While terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque’s history – and he has been around for all of it – Shafayat Mohamed’s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.
0	One stop on Shafayat Mohamed’s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover.
0	The book is “The Meaning of THE HOLY QUR’AN,” a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries.
1	In it, Jews are described as: “arrogant,” “jealous,” “selfish,” “spiteful,” “greedy,” “cursed,” “apes and swine,” and “under divine displeasure.”
1	This may seem an innocent mistake on the imam’s part, but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but.
1	In February 2005, an article written by Shafayat Mohamed was published on the Darul Uloom website, entitled ‘Tsunami: Wrath of God.’ In it, he claims that gay sex caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and that most Jews and Christians, whom he refers to as “People of the Book,” are “perverted transgressors.”
0	It is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards.
0	Even so, the imam has been unrepentant.
0	In a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled ‘Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,’ he admitted that he “got sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, ‘We don’t want him on that board.’” He said he had a choice, to “sit in Paradise or… sit on the board and go to Hell.”
0	He began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage.
0	He asked the following, “Did you hear what President Obama said?… Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?...
0	Here you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?… Are we sleeping?
0	Do you believe in the Quran?
1	Are we gonna sit and have the Quran be ridiculed?” He then cited the Christian and Jewish Bible, barking loudly, “The Bible says that if a man sleeps with a man, he should be killed!”
0	Shafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals.
0	He decried, “Listen.
0	Don’t deny it.
0	They already got Muslim gay communities.” He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States.
0	He exclaimed, “Here the President says a man can marry a man, but you can’t say a man can have four wives…!”
0	The October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in.
0	In fact, he has been involved in many, including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party’s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 (featuring Bill Clinton), 2015 and 2016.
0	And given that this author has written about this before, the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party.
0	Shafayat Mohamed is not the only Muslim extremist that has participated in the Democratic Party’s TKJ Dinner.
1	In October 2015, the dinner invocation was performed by Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, the legal adviser of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a group that actively promotes former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke.
0	Ruiz, as well, founded AMANA’s Connecticut and Puerto Rico chapters.
1	In July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Ruiz’s AMANA for posting what the ADL called a “venomous” anti-Semitic Duke video onto the group’s official website.
0	AMANA is currently promoting another anti-Semitic Duke-produced video, on the AMANA site.
1	The President of AMANA, Sofian Zakkout, has referred to Duke as “David Duke, a man to believe in!”
0	By inviting people like Shafayat Mohamed, an avowed enemy of the gay community, and Wilfredo Ruiz, whose group promotes white supremacists, to participate in its functions, the Democratic Party has effectively revealed its disregard for the concerns of those it disingenuously claims to advocate for and protect.
0	It is time for Democrats to reject the bigotry of these radicals and see them for the liability they present.
1	Failure to do so exposes the party’s liberal agenda as a sham.

0	WHO Prepares For “Worst Case” As Congo Ebola Outbreak Spreads
0	This report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge
0	In the week since we first noted the new outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of cases has risen by 50%, and The World Health Organization has now said it is preparing for “the worst case scenario.”
0	The WHO has tallied 32 suspected or confirmed cases in the northwestern area of Bikoro, on the shores of Lake Tumbathe near the border with the Republic of Congo, including 18 deaths, between April 4 and May 9.
0	The outbreak, declared by the DRC health ministry on Tuesday, is the DRC’s ninth known outbreak of Ebola since 1976,when the deadly viral disease was first identified in then-Zaire by a Belgian-led team.
0	Scientists are greatly concerned that this outbreak in the remote Bikoro region will travel 175 miles to the city of Mbandaka – the capital of Equateur province and home to around 1.2 million residents.
0	We’ve updated this map.
0	Turns out that the provincial capital of Equateur, Mbandaka, is home to roughly 1M people.
0	It’s less than 300 km or 175 miles from Bikoro and reachable by water.

0	What’s worrisome is that the most recent WHO update says that there are two probable cases at Wangata – which is very close to Mbandaka.
0	#EbolaDRC: This news gives me pause.
0	@WHO‘s latest update says there are 2 probable cases at Wangata, which is adjacent to the provincial capital, Mbandaka.

0	Peter Salma, head of emergency response at the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week: “If we see a town of that size infected with Ebola, then we are going to have a major urban outbreak,” adding “We are very concerned, and we are planning for all scenarios, including the worst-case scenario.”
0	Today I had the chance to see first-hand the #Ebola response in #DRC.
0	Teams are motivated and working hard.
0	I visited the hospital in Bikoro where patients are being treated, and lab technicians are testing samples.
0	We’re working with our partners 24/7 to stop this outbreak.

0	The WHO is planning to send up to 40 specialists to the affected area over the next week or so, while Salma adds that the UN hopes to have a mobile lab up and running this weekend, similar to the one set up by the WHO.
0	The WHO and World Food Programme are also working to set up an ‘air-bridge’ to help bring in supplies, however, only helicopters can be used until an airfield is cleared to allow larger planes to land, Mr Salama added.

0	This marks the country’s ninth epidemic since the ebola virus was identified in 1976.
0	When a small outbreak hit the DRC last year, eight people were infected and four died.
0	In 2014, 66 were infected out of which 49 died – a 74% fatality rate.
0	In the 2002-2003 outbreak, 90% of those infected died.
0	That said, on average the disease kills around half of those who contract it.
1	Ebola, a haemorrhagic fever, killed at least 11,000 across the world after it decimated West Africa and spread rapidly over the space of two years.
0	The pandemic was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO.
0	The country, rocked by back-to-back civil wars that ended in 2003, was hit the hardest by the fever, with 40 per cent of the deaths having occurred there.
0	Sierra Leone reported the highest number of Ebola cases, with nearly of all those infected having been residents of the nation.

0	Experts say the DRC’s vast, remote terrain provides an advantage, as outbreaks often remain localized and easy to isolate.
0	Bikoro, however, is not far from the Congo river – an essential waterway used for transport and commerce.
0	Downstream lies Kinshasa and Brazzaville – the DRC’s capital.
0	The two cities are home to a combined 12 million people.
0	As such, neighboring countries are on high alert.
0	Officials in Nigeria, Guinea and Gambia have incresaed screening measures along their airports and borders, measures which helped contain the virus during the West African epidemic that began in 2013.
0	Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi and the Republic of Congo – which border the DRC – have all been alerted.
0	While Kenya, which does not border the country, has issued warnings over the possible spread of Ebola.
0	Thermal guns to detect anyone with a fever have been put in place along its border with Uganda and at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
0	Concerned health officials in Nigeria, which also does not border the DRC, have put similar measures in place to keep its population safe.

0	Scientists believe Ebola is most often passed to humans by fruit bats, however porcupines, gorillas, antelope and chimpanzees could also be carriers.
0	It is transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids (and surfaces) of those infected.
0	There is currently no “proven” treatment for Ebola, however dozens of experimental drugs exist – including a vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV, which has reportedly protected nearly 6,000 people.
0	THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE
0	Originally published the Jerusalem Post.
0	On Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.
0	No, in his speech decertifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn’t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.
0	Trump’s move was not operational.
0	It was directional.
0	In his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.
1	For the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.
1	Trump began his remarks by setting out Iran’s long rap sheet of aggression against America.
1	Starting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran’s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.
0	Trump’s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime’s repression of its own people.
1	By merging Iran’s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge – or expand the wedge – between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.
1	Trump then turned his attention to Iran’s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.
0	It is notable that these remarks preceded Trump’s discussion of the nuclear deal – which was the ostensible subject of his speech.
1	Before Trump discussed Iran’s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.
0	This was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama’s nuclear pact.
1	By placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran’s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.
0	After accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.
1	Only then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.
0	By empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.
0	After putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama’s nuclear accord.
0	Among other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran’s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called “sunset” clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran’s nuclear advancement.
0	Trump’s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.
0	Such a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump’s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.
1	Unfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.
0	Trump’s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.
0	He has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.
0	Obama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn’t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama’s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.
1	Over the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker’s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.
0	Today Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump’s agenda.
0	If he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.
0	And he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran’s nuclear program.
0	What is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.
0	Leading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama’s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.
0	Indeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.
0	Then again, by framing the issue of Iran’s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive – rather than personal – debates on Iran.
0	And the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama’s Iran policy – that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran’s illicit nuclear weapons program.
0	The second major risk inherent in Trump’s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.
0	The problem here is not obvious.
0	Clearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.
0	Yet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran’s nuclear program.
1	An improved deal won’t destroy Iran’s centrifuges.
1	It won’t take away Iran’s enriched uranium.
1	It won’t destroy Iran’s nuclear installations.
1	And it won’t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.
0	So long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.
1	Distressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.
0	To understand what must be done we must return to Trump’s speech and its strategic significance.
0	By taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat – grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime – Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.
0	If the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.
0	A wider strategy would target Iran’s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.
0	It would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs’ domestic opponents.
0	It would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.
0	Friday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.
0	It is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.
1	If they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.
1	End The Korean War!
1	“I have some pretty severe things we’re thinking about,” Trump said of North Korea at a news conference in Warsaw.
0	“Doesn’t mean we’re going to do them.”
0	What President Trump really meant is that he has painted the US into a corner with all his threats of war and really does not know what to do next.
0	North Korea called his ‘or else’ bluff.
0	Good.
0	No action on North Korea is better than any conceivable military operation.
0	Last week the North Korea test fired a new, longer-ranged strategic missile, Hwasong-14, that US experts claimed was capable of hitting Alaska and perhaps even San Francisco.
0	North Korea is now believed to have mastered a lightweight nuclear warhead that can be carried by the Hwasong and shorter-ranged Taepodong and Nodong missiles.
0	North Korea can’t today seriously threaten North America with missile strikes, but it probably will by 2019.
1	Meanwhile, North Korean nuclear and conventionally-armed missiles (and this could include poison gas and biological warheads) today threaten the 80,000 plus US military personnel based in Japan, South Korea and Guam.
1	They would be immediate targets should the US and South Korea attack the north.

0	Half of South Korea’s capitol, Seoul, is within range of North Korean heavy artillery and rocket batteries dug into the so-called Demilitarized Zone.

1	Nuclear explosions would spread radioactive contamination over northern China and Pacific Russia.
0	Why are we even talking about nuclear war in North Asia?
1	Because North Korea has scraped and skimped for decades to build nuclear weapons for the sole reason of deterring a major US attack, including the use by the US of tactical nuclear weapons.
1	Pakistan ‘ate grass’ for decades to afford nuclear weapons to offset the threat from far more powerful India.
0	Israel uses the same argument to justify its large nuclear arsenal.
1	After Washington overthrew the rulers of Iraq and Libya, it became painfully apparent that small nations without nuclear weapons were vulnerable to US ‘regime change’ operations.
1	The North Koreans, who are very eccentric but not stupid, rushed to accelerate their nuclear weapons and delivery systems.
0	Almost equally important, North Korea boasts one of the word’s biggest armies – 1,020,000 men, 88,000 crack special forces, and an trained militia of over 5 million.
1	The North’s weapons are obsolescent; its small air forces and navy will be vaporized by US power but its troops are deeply dug into the mountainous terrain and would be fighting from prepared positions.
1	War against North Korea would be a slow and bloody slog– even a repeat of the bloody, stalemated 1950-52 Korean War in which 39,000 Americans and at least 2.5 million Koreans died.
0	I’ve been in the deep North Korean-dug tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone.
0	A full division can be moved through in only 60 minutes.
1	Ever since being soundly beaten in Vietnam and fought to a draw in Afghanistan, the US military has preferred to attack small countries like Panama, Grenada, Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.
0	The Pentagon is not eager to tangle with the tough North Koreans.
0	Estimates of the cost of a US invasion of North Korea have run as high as 250,000 US casualties and tens of billions of dollars.
1	Seemingly heedless of these hard facts, President Trump – who himself avoided national military service in the 1960’s – keeps beating the war drums over North Korea and needling its thin-skinned regime with naval exercises, over-flights, and intensifying bombast.
1	North Korea’s Kim Jong-un has played right along, clearly relishing his game of chicken with tough-talking Donald Trump.
0	Trump seemed certain he could somehow cajole China into disarming North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.
0	But the administration’s amateur foreign policymakers failed to understand that the only “deal” that could get China to disarm the North was by agreeing to remove all US military bases from the region – South Korea, Japan and Guam – and also moving the US Seventh Fleet far from China’s coasts.

1	Talk of US-South Korean plans to “decapitate’ North Korea’s leadership with missile strikes and commando raids keeps giving Pyongyang the jitters.
0	South Korea’s new president, Moon Jae-in, demanded that his nation be consulted before any military action.
0	But Moon’s pleas have been largely ignored by Trump.
1	Most South Koreans shrug off the North’s threats and seek to avoid war at all costs.
0	Of course.
0	They would be the primary victims.
0	The US has spent over $200 billion on ballistic anti-missile systems in recent years designed to stop North Korean missiles.
